      <td>Effective strategies for mental disorders prevention and its risk factors’ reduction cannot be gender neutral while the risks themselves are gender specifi c. This paper aims to discuss why gender matters in mental health to explain the relationship of gender and health-seeking behaviour as a powerful determinant of gender differences to examine the gender differences in common mental health disorders namely depressive and anxiety disorders eating disorders schizophrenia and domestic violence and fi nally to raise some recommendations stemming from this review.</td>

      <td>Observers Discrete-time systems Asymptotic stability Uncertainty Trajectory\nEstimation error Linear matrix inequalities</td>
      <td>In this paper we investigate the interval observer problem for a class of discrete-time nonlinear systems in absence or presence of external disturbances and parametric uncertainties. The interval observers depend on the design of two preserving order observers providing lower and upper estimations of the state. The main objective is to apply the stability radii notions and cooperativity property in the estimation error systems in order to guarantee that the lower/upper estimation is always below/above the real state trajectory at each time instant from an appropriate initialization and the estimation errors converge asymptotically towards zero when the disturbances and/or uncertainties are vanishing. For the disturbed case the estimation errors practically converge to a vicinity of zero while the lower/upper estimations preserve the partial ordering with respect to the state trajectory. The design conditions that are valid for Lipschitz nonlinearities can be expressed as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). A numerical simulation example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</td>

      <td>During the COVID-19 pandemic many countries enforced mandatory stay-at-home orders. The\nconfinement period that took place may be regarded as a multi-domain work-life shock event\nseverely disrupting both the professional and the family sphere. Taking an identity lens this study\nexamines whether and how identity changed during confinment by drawing from a diary study\nconsisting of 14 working parents who filled out a daily diary over a period of seven weeks of\nmandated home confinement in France. The findings suggest how both work-related and familyrelated identity change may occur when individuals are confronted with a multi-domain work-life\nshock event such as the pandemic. Further the findings point to three identity responses to this\nevent: work-life identity threat work-life identity reflection and work-life identity reconstruction. For most participants the seven-week period resulted in significant and positive shifts in\ntheir work and family identities to better align with their internal beliefs rather than relying on\nsocietally imposed expectations about what it means to be a good parent and worker.</td>
