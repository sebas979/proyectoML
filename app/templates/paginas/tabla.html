      <td>Data sharing in cloud computing enables multiple participants to freely share the group data which improves the efficiency of work in cooperative environments and has widespread potential applications. However how to ensure the security of data sharing within a group and how to efficiently share the outsourced data in a group manner are formidable challenges. Note that key agreement protocols have played a very important role in secure and efficient group data sharing in cloud computing. In this paper by taking advantage of the symmetric balanced incomplete block design (SBIBD) we present a novel block design-based key agreement protocol that supports multiple participants which can flexibly extend the number of participants in a cloud environment according to the structure of the block design. Based on the proposed group data sharing model we present general formulas for generating the common conference key IC for multiple participants. Note that by benefiting from the (v k + 1 1)-block design the computational complexity of the proposed protocol linearly increases with the number of participants and the communication complexity is greatly reduced. In addition the fault tolerance property of our protocol enables the group data sharing in cloud computing to withstand different key attacks which is similar to Yi's protocol.</td>

      <td>Cloud computing Access control History Encryption Data models</td>
      <td>Cloud data storage has provided significant benefits by allowing users to store massive amount of data on demand in a cost-effective manner. To protect the privacy of data stored in the cloud cryptographic role-based access control (RBAC) schemes have been developed to ensure that the data can only be accessed by those who are allowed by access policies. However these cryptographic approaches do not address the issues of trust. In this paper we propose trust models to reason about and to improve the security for stored data in cloud storage systems that use cryptographic RBAC schemes. The trust models provide an approach for the owners and roles to determine the trustworthiness of individual roles and users respectively in the RBAC system. The proposed trust models consider role inheritance and hierarchy in the evaluation of trustworthiness of roles. We present a design of a trust-based cloud storage system which shows how the trust models can be integrated into a system that uses cryptographic RBAC schemes. We have also considered practical application scenarios and illustrated how the trust evaluations can be used to reduce the risks and to enhance the quality of decision making by data owners and roles of cloud storage service.</td>

Secure cloud storage was proposed only recently while secure network coding has been studied for more than ten years. We show in general how to construct a secure cloud storage protocol given any secure network coding protocol. Our construction suggests a systematic way to construct various secure cloud storage protocols. We also show that it is secure under a definition which captures the real world uses of the cloud storage. From our general construction we propose a secure cloud storage protocol based on a recent secure network coding protocol. The protocol is the first publicly verifiable secure cloud storage protocol in the standard model while the previous work is either not publicly verifiable or security argument is only argued heuristically in the random oracle model. We also enhance the proposed protocol to support third-party public auditing which has received considerable attention recently. Finally we prototype the proposed protocol and evaluate its performance. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the protocol.</td>

      <td>Wireless body area networks (WBANs) consist of many small low-power sensors through which users could monitor the real-time parameters of patients' physiology remotely. This capability could improve medical care and the monitoring of patients. WBAN devices typically have limited computing storage power and communication capabilities. These limitations restrict the applications that WBANs can support. To enhance the capabilities of WBANs the concept of cloud-assisted WBANs has been introduced recently. By using cloud computing technologies cloud-assisted WBANs can provide more efficient processing of patients' physiology parameters and support richer services. In cloud-assisted WBANs the data of patients' physiology are stored in the cloud. The integrity of the data is very important because these data will be used to provide a medical diagnosis and other medical treatments. To address the issue of integrity in cloud-assisted WBANs we propose an efficient certificateless public auditing (CLPA) scheme. A security analysis of our proposed CLPA scheme shows that it is provably secure against two types of adversaries (i.e. a type-I adversary can replace users' public keys and a type-II adversary can access the master key) in an environment of certificateless cryptography. A detailed performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed CLPA scheme yields better performance over a previously proposed CLPA scheme.</td>

      <td>As the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology continues to evolve and mature RFID tags can be implemented in a wide range of applications. Due to the shared wireless medium between the RFID reader and the RFID tag adversaries can launch various attacks on the RFID system. To thwart different types of attacks we propose an Efficient RFID Authentication Protocol (ERAP) which can accomplish the authentication without disclosing real IDs of the participating tags and provide strong privacy and security protection of the RFID users. ERAP offers the anonymity of tags in addition to tag untraceability. It also provides forward security (forward privacy) which ensures that data transmitted today will still be secure even if secret tag information is revealed by tampering in the future. In this paper we define a formal security model for authentication and privacy in RFID system. Under this model we describe protocol that provably achieves the properties of authentication and privacy. In addition the proposed ERAP requires only little resources to perform the authentication which satisfies the requirement of highly resource-constrained low-cost RFID tags.</td>

      <td>Cloud computing Protocols Outsourcing Cryptography Computational modeling Computer science</td>
      <td>Key-exposure resistance has always been an important issue for in-depth cyber defence in many security applications. Recently how to deal with the key exposure problem in the settings of cloud storage auditing has been proposed and studied. To address the challenge existing solutions all require the client to update his secret keys in every time period which may inevitably bring in new local burdens to the client especially those with limited computation resources such as mobile phones. In this paper we focus on how to make the key updates as transparent as possible for the client and propose a new paradigm called cloud storage auditing with verifiable outsourcing of key updates. In this paradigm key updates can be safely outsourced to some authorized party and thus the key-update burden on the client will be kept minimal. In particular we leverage the third party auditor (TPA) in many existing public auditing designs let it play the role of authorized party in our case and make it in charge of both the storage auditing and the secure key updates for key-exposure resistance. In our design TPA only needs to hold an encrypted version of the client's secret key while doing all these burdensome tasks on behalf of the client. The client only needs to download the encrypted secret key from the TPA when uploading new files to cloud. Besides our design also equips the client with capability to further verify the validity of the encrypted secret keys provided by the TPA. All these salient features are carefully designed to make the whole auditing procedure with key exposure resistance as transparent as possible for the client. We formalize the definition and the security model of this paradigm. The security proof and the performance simulation show that our detailed design instantiations are secure and efficient.</td>

      <td>Protocols Authentication Fault tolerant systems</td>
      <td>Key agreement protocol is a fundamental protocol in cryptography whereby two or more participants can agree on a common conference key in order to communicate securely among themselves. In this situation the participants can securely send and receive messages with each other. An adversary not having access to the conference key will not be able to decrypt the messages. In this paper we propose a novel identity-based authenticated multi user key agreement protocol employing a symmetric balanced incomplete block design. Our protocol is built on elliptic curve cryptography and takes advantage of a kind of bilinear map called Weil pairing. The protocol presented can provide an identification (ID)-based authentication service and resist different key attacks. Furthermore our protocol is efficient and needs only two rounds for generating a common conference key. It is worth noting that the com munication cost for generating a conference key in our protocol is only O(n√n) and the computation cost is only O(nm 2 ) where n implies the number of participants and m denotes the extension degree of the finite field Fp m . In addition in order to resist the different key attack from malicious participants our protocol can be further extended to provide the fault tolerant property.</td>

Interestingly in addition to satisfying stronger security guarantees our constructions are more efficient than all previous constructions. Further prior work on SSE only considered the setting where only the owner of the data is capable of submitting search queries.

      <td>With the advent of cloud computing data owners are motivated to outsource their complex data management systems from local sites to the commercial public cloud for great flexibility and economic savings. But for protecting data privacy sensitive data have to be encrypted before outsourcing which obsoletes traditional data utilization based on plaintext keyword search. Thus enabling an encrypted cloud data search service is of paramount importance. Considering the large number of data users and documents in the cloud it is necessary to allow multiple keywords in the search request and return documents in the order of their relevance to these keywords. Related works on searchable encryption focus on single keyword search or Boolean keyword search and rarely sort the search results. In this paper for the first time we define and solve the challenging problem of privacy-preserving multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted data in cloud computing (MRSE). We establish a set of strict privacy requirements for such a secure cloud data utilization system. Among various multi-keyword semantics we choose the efficient similarity measure of "coordinate matching" i.e. as many matches as possible to capture the relevance of data documents to the search query. We further use "inner product similarity" to quantitatively evaluate such similarity measure. We first propose a basic idea for the MRSE based on secure inner product computation and then give two significantly improved MRSE schemes to achieve various stringent privacy requirements in two different threat models. To improve search experience of the data search service we further extend these two schemes to support more search semantics. Thorough analysis investigating privacy and efficiency guarantees of proposed schemes is given. Experiments on the real-world data set further show proposed schemes indeed introduce low overhead on computation and communication.</td>

      <td>Cloud storage auditing is viewed as an important service to verify the integrity of the data in public cloud. Current auditing protocols are all based on the assumption that the client's secret key for auditing is absolutely secure. However such assumption may not always be held due to the possibly weak sense of security and/or low security settings at the client. If such a secret key for auditing is exposed most of the current auditing protocols would inevitably become unable to work. In this paper we focus on this new aspect of cloud storage auditing. We investigate how to reduce the damage of the client's key exposure in cloud storage auditing and give the first practical solution for this new problem setting. We formalize the definition and the security model of auditing protocol with key-exposure resilience and propose such a protocol. In our design we employ the binary tree structure and the preorder traversal technique to update the secret keys for the client. We also develop a novel authenticator construction to support the forward security and the property of blockless verifiability. The security proof and the performance analysis show that our proposed protocol is secure and efficient.</td>

The primary advantages of our proposed mechanism are that the VO is independent of the database size and that relational operations can still be fulfilled by the edge servers.

      <td>In recent years the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices/sensors has increased to a great extent. To support the computational demand of real-time latency-sensitive applications of largely geo-distributed IoT devices/sensors a new computing paradigm named “Fog computing” has been introduced. Generally Fog computing resides closer to the IoT devices/sensors and extends the Cloud-based computing storage and networking facilities. In this chapter we comprehensively analyse the challenges in Fogs acting as an intermediate layer between IoT devices/sensors and Cloud datacentres and review the current developments in this field. We present a taxonomy of Fog computing according to the identified challenges and its key features. We also map the existing works to the taxonomy in order to identify current research gaps in the area of Fog computing. Moreover based on the observations we propose future directions for research.</td>

      <td>The Internet of Everything (IoE) solutions gradually bring every object online and processing data in a centralized cloud does not scale to requirements of such an environment. This is because there are applications such as health monitoring and emergency response that require low latency so delay caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to the application can seriously impact the performance. To this end Fog computing has emerged where cloud computing is extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and network congestion. Fog computing is a paradigm for managing a highly distributed and possibly virtualized environment that provides compute and network services between sensors and cloud data centers. This chapter provides a background and motivations regarding the emergence of Fog computing and defines its key characteristics. In addition a reference architecture for Fog computing is presented and recent related development and applications are discussed.</td>

      <td>With the increasing applications in the domains of ubiquitous and context-aware computing Internet of Things (IoT) are gaining importance. In IoTs literally anything can be part of it whether it is sensor nodes or dumb objects so very diverse types of services can be produced. In this regard resource management service creation service management service discovery data storage and power management would require much better infrastructure and sophisticated mechanism. The amount of data IoTs are going to generate would not be possible for standalone power-constrained IoTs to handle. Cloud computing comes into play here. Integration of IoTs with cloud computing termed as Cloud of Things (CoT) can help achieve the goals of envisioned IoT and future Internet. This IoT-Cloud computing integration is not straight-forward. It involves many challenges. One of those challenges is data trimming. Because unnecessary communication not only burdens the core network but also the data center in the cloud. For this purpose data can be preprocessed and trimmed before sending to the cloud. This can be done through a Smart Gateway accompanied with a Smart Network or Fog Computing. In this paper we have discussed this concept in detail and present the architecture of Smart Gateway with Fog Computing. We have tested this concept on the basis of Upload Delay Synchronization Delay Jitter Bulk-data Upload Delay and Bulk-data Synchronization Delay.</td>

      <td>Current developments in ICTs such as in Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS) allow us to develop healthcare solutions with more intelligent and prediction capabilities both for daily life (home/office) and in-hospitals. In most of IoT-based healthcare systems especially at smart homes or hospitals a bridging point (i.e. gateway) is needed between sensor infrastructure network and the Internet. The gateway at the edge of the network often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper we exploit the strategic position of such gateways at the edge of the network to offer several higher-level services such as local storage real-time local data processing embedded data mining etc. presenting thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. We then propose to exploit the concept of Fog Computing in Healthcare IoT systems by forming a Geo-distributed intermediary layer of intelligence between sensor nodes and Cloud. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center our Fog-assisted system architecture can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as mobility energy efficiency scalability and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways can enable massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a prototype of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UT-GATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented. We also implement an IoT-based Early Warning Score (EWS) health monitoring to practically show the efficiency and relevance of our system on addressing a medical case study. Our proof-of-concept design demonstrates an IoT-based health monitoring system with enhanced overall system intelligence energy efficiency mobility performance interoperability security and reliability.</td>

      <td>Internet of Things (IoT) offers a seamless platform to connect people and objects to one another for enriching and making our lives easier. This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables smart home smart mobility and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital patient and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety speed and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health assisted living e-medicine implants early warning systems to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management scalability regulations interoperability device–network–human interfaces security and privacy.</td>

      <td>Lately pervasive and ubiquitous computing services have been under focus of not only the research community but developers as well. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Emergency healthcare and latency sensitive services require real-time response. Also it is necessary to decide what type of data is to be uploaded in the cloud without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose Fog computing plays an important role. Fog resides between underlying IoTs and the cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources perform data filtration preprocessing and security measures. For this purpose Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework which we provide in this paper. Moreover since Fog has to deal with mobile nodes and IoTs which involves objects and devices of different types having a fluctuating connectivity behavior. All such types of service customers have an unpredictable relinquish probability since any object or device can quit resource utilization at any moment. In our proposed methodology for resource estimation and management we have taken into account these factors and formulate resource management on the basis of fluctuating relinquish probability of the customer service type service price and variance of the relinquish probability. Implementation of our system was done using Java while evaluation was done on CloudSim toolkit. The discussion and results show that these factors can help service provider estimate the right amount of resources according to each type of service customers.</td>

      <td>Chikungunya is a vector borne disease that spreads quickly in geographically affected areas. Its outbreak results in acute illness that may lead to chronic phase. Chikungunya virus (CHV) diagnosis solutions are not easily accessible and affordable in developing countries. Also old approaches are very slow in identifying and controlling the spread of CHV outbreak. The sudden development and advancement of wearable internet of things (IoT) sensors fog computing mobile technology cloud computing and better internet coverage have enhanced the quality of remote healthcare services. IoT assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to identify possibly infected users from CHV in an early phase of their illness so that the outbreak of CHV can be controlled. Fog computing provides many benefits such as low latency minimum response time high mobility enhanced service quality location awareness and notification service itself at the edge of the network. In this paper IoT and fog based healthcare system is proposed to identify and control the outbreak of CHV. Fuzzy-C means (FCM) is used to diagnose the possibly infected users and immediately generate diagnostic and emergency alerts to users from fog layer. Furthermore on cloud server social network analysis (SNA) is used to represent the state of CHV outbreak. Outbreak role index is calculated from SNA graph which represents the probability of any user to receive or spread the infection. It also generates warning alerts to government and healthcare agencies to control the outbreak of CHV in risk prone or infected regions. The experimental results highlight the advantages of using both fog computing and cloud computing services together for achieving network bandwidth efficiency high quality of service and minimum response time in generation of real time notification as compared to a cloud only model.</td>

People’s perception is shifting towards patient-centered rather than the classical hospital–centered health services which has been propelling the evolution of telemedicine research from the classic e-Health to m-Health and now is to ubiquitous healthcare (u-Health). It is expected that mobile &amp; ubiquitous Telemedicine integrated with Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) have a great potential in fostering the provision of next-generation u-Health. Despite the recent efforts and achievements current u-Health proposed solutions still suffer from shortcomings hampering their adoption today.

It compares new technological and technical trends and discusses how they address expected u-Health requirements. A thorough survey on various worldwide recent system implementations is presented in an attempt to identify shortcomings in state-of-the art solutions. In particular challenges in WBAN and ubiquitous computing were emphasized. The purpose of this survey is not only to help beginners with a holistic approach toward understanding u-Health systems but also present to researchers new technological trends and design challenges they have to cope with while designing such systems.</td>
