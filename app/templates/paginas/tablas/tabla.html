      <td>The effect of stochastic fluctuations in the background zonal velocity field on the energy dispersion of stationary wave responses to meridionally localised forcing is considered using the non-divergent barotropic vorticity equation. It is found that for small noise levels or large lengthscales in the noise autocovariance function the oscillatory structure of the solutions is not altered. However for noise levels (or autocovariance lengthscales) comparable to or larger (smaller) than those observed in the circulation at 300mb the marginal density functions of the solution process displays a pronounced attenuation away from the stationary wave source. This indicates that fluctuations in the velocity field inhibit the dispersion of wave energy. The symmetry of the marginal PDFs about the source rather than about the equator indicates that the localisation is primarily an integrated effect of backscattering by potential vorticity gradients in regions of real refractive index and not due to attenuation by regions of imaginary refractive index or by critical lines in the flow.</td>

      <td>To investigate how the propagation of energy away from steady sources may be influenced by the horizontal structure of the time-averaged flow in the troposphere solutions to a barotropic model are displayed and interpreted. The model is steady and linearized about a basic state which varies in latitude and longitude. Emphasis is placed on cases where the longitudinal variations are gradual.\n\nMany of the results can be analyzed by locally applying tools developed for zonally symmetric basic states e.g. ray tracing and refractive indices. Simple background flows are constructed which have longitudinally confined critical lines reflective surfaces wave guides and regions conducive to propagation. An example is given in which longitudinal derivatives of the basic state are significant. The theory of ray tracing in a two-dimensional wind must be employed as an interpretive tool in this case. It is concluded that zonal variations tend to enhance poleward (equatorward) propagation in large-scale troughs (ridges).\n\nExamples are also shown of propagation through observed January 300 mb mean flow. These experiments suggest that the southern flank of the Asiatic jet may act as a partial reflector increasing the likelihood of resonance in the midlatitudes. The central tropical Pacific appears to have potential as a corridor for inter-hemispheric transmission though during typical January conditions wavetrains emanating from the mid-latitudes are absorbed there.</td>

      <td>Do Rossby-wave critical layers absorb reflect or over-reflect?</td>
      <td>hydrodynamically\ntwo-dimensional \nasymptotic expansions</td>
      <td>The Stewartson–Warn–Warn (SWW) solution for the time evolution of an inviscid nonlinear Rossby-wave critical layer which predicts that the critical layer will alternate between absorbing and over-reflecting states as time goes on is shown to be hydrodynamically unstable. The instability is a two-dimensional shear instability owing its existence to a local reversal of the cross-stream absolute vorticity gradient within the long thin Kelvin cat's eyes of the SWW streamline pattern. The unstable condition first develops while the critical layer is still an absorber well before the first over-reflecting stage is reached. The exponentially growing modes have a two-scale cross-stream structure like that of the basic SWW solution. They are found analytically using the method of matched asymptotic expansions enabling the problem to be reduced to a transcendental equation for the complex eigenvalue. Growth rates are of the order of the inner vorticity scale δq i.e. the initial absolute vorticity gradient dq0/dy times the critical-layer width scale. This is much faster than the time evolution of the SWW solution itself albeit much slower than the shear rate du0/dy of the basic flow. Nonlinear saturation of the growing instability is expected to take place in a central region of width comparable to the width of the SWW cat's-eye pattern probably leading to chaotic motion there with very large ‘eddy-viscosity’ values. Those values correspond to critical-layer Reynolds numbers δ−1 [Lt ] 1 suggesting that for most initial conditions the time evolution of the critical layer will depart drastically from that predicted by the SWW solution. A companion paper (Haynes 1985) establishes that the instability can indeed grow to large enough amplitudes for this to happen.\n\nThe simplest way in which the instability could affect the time evolution of the critical layer would be to prevent or reduce the oscillations between over-reflecting and absorbing states which according to the SWW solution follow the first onset of perfect reflection. The possibility that absorption (or over-reflection) might be prolonged indefinitely is ruled out in many cases of interest (even if the ‘eddy viscosity’ is large) by the existence of a rigorous general upper bound on the magnitude of the time-integrated absorptivity α(t). The bound is uniformly valid for all time t. The absorptivity α(t) is defined as the integral over all past t of the jump in the wave-induced Reynolds stress across the critical layer. In typical cases the bound implies that no matter how large t may become |α(t)| cannot greatly exceed the rate of absorption predicted by linear theory multiplied by the timescale on which linear theory breaks down say the time for the cat's-eye flow to twist up the absolute vorticity contours by about half a turn. An alternative statement is that |α(t)| cannot greatly exceed the initial absolute vorticity gradient dq0/dy times the cube of the widthscale of the critical layer. In typical cases therefore a brief answer to the question posed in the title is that the critical layer absorbs at first at a rate ∞ dq0/dy whereas after linear theory breaks down the critical layer becomes a perfect reflector in the long-time average. If absolute vorticity gradients vanish throughout the critical layer then the bound is zero implying perfect reflection for all t.\n\nThe general conditions for the bound to apply are that the wave amplitude and critical-layer width are uniformly bounded for all t the motion is two-dimensional and vorticity is neither created nor destroyed within the critical layer nor transported into or out of it by diffusion by advection or by other means. Vorticity may however be diffused or turbulently transported within the critical layer provided that the region within which the transport acts is of bounded width and the range of values of vorticity within that region remains bounded. There are no other restrictions on wave amplitude none on wavelength and no assumptions about flow details within the critical layer nor about the initial vorticity profile qo(y) apart from an assumption that q0(y) has singularities no worse than a finite number of jump discontinuities. The proof in its most general form makes use of anew finite-amplitude conservation theorem for disturbances to parallel shear flows generalizing the classical results of Taylor Eliassen &amp; Palm and others.</td>

      <td>The extratropical response to localized low-frequency tropical forcing is examined using a linearized non-divergent barotropic model on a sphere. Zonal-mean basic states characterized by solid-body rotation or critical latitudes are considered. An analytical analysis based on WKB and ray tracing methods shows that in contrast to stationary Rossby waves westward moving low-frequency Rossby waves can propagate through the tropical easterlies into the extratropics. It is shown analytically that the difference between the stationary and low-frequency ray paths is proportional to the forcing frequency and inversely proportional to the zonal wavenumber cubed. An expression for the disturbance amplitude is derived that shows the ability of the forced waves to maintain their strength well into middle latitudes depends on their meridional wave scale and northward group velocity both of which are functions of the slowly varying background flow.\n\nA local energetics analysis shows that the combination of energy dispersion from the forcing region and energy extraction from the equatorward flank of the midlatitude jet produces disturbances that have the greatest impact on the extratropical circulation. Under the assumption that the forcing amplitude is independent of frequency this impact is largest when the tropical forcing period is in the range 10–20 days.</td>

      <td>A spherical nondivergent barotropic model linearized about a 300-mb climatological January flow is used to examine the extratropical response to low-frequency tropical forcing. A two-dimensional WKB analysis shows that the energy propagation depends on the sum of three vectors: the basic state wind vector a vector that is parallel to the absolute vorticity contours and the local wave vector. The latter two vectors are functions of the slowly varying background flow and forcing frequency ω. As ω decreases the ray paths approach that of the local wave vector so that the energy propagates in a direction perpendicular to the wave fronts. The extratropical jet streams have a stronger influence on the long period (&gt;30 day) ray paths than on those of intermediate period (∼10–30 day).\n\nGlobal and local energetics calculations show that the energy conversion from the zonally varying basic flow increases as ω decreases. The local energetics show that for the long period disturbances both the energy conversion and energy redistribution due to advection and pressure work are significant along the North African–Asian jet stream. The long period disturbances are less sensitive to the location of the tropical forcing than those of intermediate period. This provides a plausible explanation for the observations showing that the long period oscillations tend to be geographically fixed at the exits of the extratropical jet streams whereas those of intermediate period are zonally mobile wave trains. The long (intermediate) timescale disturbances dominate in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere where the zonal variations in the basic flow are more (less) pronounced.</td>

      <td>The relationship between deep tropical convection and large-scale atmospheric circulation in the 6–30-day period range is examined. Regression relationships between filtered outgoing longwave radiation at various locations in the Tropics and 200- and 850-mb circulation are mapped for the standard seasons and the spatial structure and seasonal dependence of the results are interpreted in view of the basic-state circulation.\n\nIn regions where the convection is embedded in upper-level easterlies anomalous equatorial easterly flow is typically present at 200 mb within and to the west of the convective signal along with patterns of meridional outflow into subtropical anticyclonic perturbations. Lagged relationships suggest that the convection is forcing the circulation in many of these cases. The outflow and subtropical circulations are strongest into the winter hemisphere during the solstitial seasons with more symmetric signals about the equator seen in the equinoctial seasons. The longitudinal positioning of the subtropical features with respect to the convection varies but is generally located due poleward or just to the east of the convection. There tends to be a first baroclinic mode vertical structure to these circulations such that equatorial westerlies are present at 850 mb within the convection with closed circulations on either side of the equator resembling equatorial Rossby modes especially common over the Atlantic and Pacific sectors.\n\nAs a contrast in regions located within upper-level westerlies or along the margin of influence of upper westerly disturbances convection appears to be forced by upper-level wave energy propagating into the deep Tropics with the heating located in the upward motion region ahead of upper-level troughs. This occurs over the Atlantic and eastern Pacific sectors during northern winter and spring and over Australia the South Pacific and South America during southern summer when upper westerlies are at relatively low latitudes where they can interact with deep tropical convection. The results confirm theoretical and modeling ideas that suggest that Rossby wave energy is able to propagate into the deep Tropics in regions where upper-level westerlies exist in the Tropics.</td>

      <td>Lagged cross correlations between outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and National Meteorological Center global analyses are utilized to isolate the preferred upper-level and surface circulation anomalies associated with tropical convection during northern winter. Three intraseasonal time scales are studied: 30–70 14–30 and 6–14 days. In the 30–70-day band the upper-level circulation signals are zonally elongated with zonal wavenumbers 0–2 dominant. Higher-frequency signals are dominated by zonal wavenumbers 5 and 6. In the 14–30-day band convection over the eastern hemisphere is associated with upper-level anticyclones in the subtropics and appears to be linked in some cases to midlatitude wave trains. The strongest signals are for convection over Africa Australia and the eastern Indian Ocean. Only weak signals are seen for convection over Indonesia. In these regions of upper-level easterlies OLR anomalies peak prior to the maximum anomalies in wind suggesting forcing of the circulation by tropical heating.\n\nIn contrast 14–30-day and 6–14-day convection over the eastern tropical Pacific eastern South America and central South Pacific is primarily associated with the intrusion of troughs in the westerlies originating in the extratropics. These are regions of mean upper level westerly flow or where upper-westerlies lie adjacent to tropical convergence zones overlain by only weak easterly flow aloft. The large amplitude of these troughs prior to the OLR anomaly is indicative of the forcing of the convection by these disturbances.</td>

      <td>Statistical evidence is presented to support the notion that tropical convection in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) during northern winter can be forced by disturbances originating in the extratropics. The synoptic-scale transients in these regions are characterized at upper levels by strong positive tilts in the horizontal and appear to induce vertical motions ahead of troughs as in midlatitude baroclinic systems. Two case studies of such interactions are examined one for the eastern North Pacific ITCZ and another somewhat different type of interaction for the South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) over the western South Pacific.\n\nBoth cases are associated with upper-level troughs strong cold advection deep into the tropics and the formation of a frontal boundary at low levels. The ITCZ case is characterized by the advection of anomalously high isentropic potential vorticity air southward a strong poleward flux of heat and westerly momentum and the development of a subtropical jet downstream of the disturbance. The SPCZ disturbance is not strongly tilted but is still accompanied by a strong poleward flux of heat and momentum. Evidence for the occurrence of cross-equatorial wave dispersion in the eastern Pacific during northern winter is also presented. These observations are consistent with theory and modeling of Rossby waves in a westerly basic state extending from the midlatitudes into the tropics.</td>

      <td>The nonlinear reflection of an isolated Rossby wave train at a low-latitude wave-breaking region is contrasted with the more familiar longitudinally periodic case. General theoretical arguments for nonlinear reflection based on absorptivity bounds do not carry over to the case of an isolated wave train and detailed investigation is needed to determine the absorption-reflection behavior. Numerical experiments in a single-layer shallow-water model show that wave activity is reflected back into midlatitudes (rather than propagating longitudinally at low latitudes). Finite-amplitudes wave activity diagnostics are used to analyze the nonlinear reflection. Further idealized numerical simulations and simple ideas concerning the propagation of Rossby waves in shear flows are used to give insight into the nonlinear reflection.</td>

      <td>In this paper we investigate the meridional propagation of a forced Rossby wave packet towards a critical layer in a zonal shear flow by solving the linearized barotropic vorticity equation. The forcing is applied north of the critical layer. Two approaches are employed for solving this problem. First an analytic solution valid for large time is derived using Fourier and Laplace transform techniques and asymptotic approximations. This solution exhibits the modification due to the wave packet of the solution obtained by Warn and Warn (1976) [Warn T. Warn H. 1976. On the development of a Rossby wave critical level. J. Atmos. Sci. 33 2021–2024.] in the monochromatic case. A numerical investigation is then carried out using a finite difference scheme and a time-dependent radiation condition. It is found that the forced wave packet is absorbed at the critical layer and the total momentum transferred to the mean flow as a result of the absorption is observed to be proportional to the length scale of the wave packet. We also consider the case of a north–south mean flow with a longitudinally propagating wave packet forced to the east or west of the critical layer. The monochromatic version of this problem has been used before (Geisler J.E. Dickinson R.E. 1975. Critical level absorption of barotropic Rossby waves in a north–south flow. J. Geophys. Res. 80 3805–3811.) to examine the interaction of western boundary currents and oceanic Rossby waves.</td>

      <td>The response of a barotropic model linearized about a climatological 300-mb December–February time-mean flow to localized forcing is considered. In order to aid the design of the experiments and interpretation of the results a simplified analysis is made of the basic flow in terms of zonal wind meridional vorticity gradient and stationary wavenumber. From the analysis the possible existence of a strong waveguide in the Asian jet and weaker waveguides in the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere jets is deduced. The possibility of propagation into the equatorial east Pacific and Atlantic oceans and even across these regions is also suggested. These features are confirmed by barotropic model integrations for a variety of perturbation vorticity source positions and shapes. These integrations also show preferred propagation regions arching across North America from Europe to the Arabian Gulf and in the Southern Hemisphere into the equatorial Indian Ocean and Indonesian regions. They also show a tendency to produce a low-wavenumber fast westward-moving “tail” along the Asian jet. Many of the features found in this study are remarkably consistent with observational teleconnection studies.</td>

      <td>Motivated by some results from barotropic models a linearized steady-state five-layer baroclinic model is used to study the response of a spherical atmosphere to thermal and orographic forcing. At low levels the significant perturbations are confined to the neighborhood of the source and for midlatitude thermal forcing these perturbations are crucially dependent on the vertical distribution of the source. In the upper troposphere the sources generate wavetrains which are very similar to those given by barotropic models. For a low-latitude source long wavelengths propagate strongly polewards as well as eastwards. Shorter wavelengths are trapped equatorward of the poleward flank of the jet resulting in a split of the wave-trains at this latitude. Using reasonable dissipation magnitudes the easiest way to produce an appreciable response in middle and high latitudes is by subtropical forcing. These results suggest an explanation for the shapes of patterns described in observational studies.\n\nThe theory for waves propagating in a slowly varying medium is applied to Rossby waves propagating in a barotropic atmosphere. The slow variation of the medium is associated with the sphericity of the domain and the latitudinal structure of the zonal wind. Rays along which wave activity propagates the speeds of propagation and the amplitudes and phases along these rays are determined for a constant angular velocity basic flow as well as a more realistic jet flow. They agree well with the observational and numerical model results and give a simple interpretation of them.</td>

      <td>In this article we develop some mathematically rigorous ideas to explain the phenomenon of localisation of planetary waves in a stochastic background flow as presented in the physical companion paper. For this purpose the barotropic vorticity equation linearised around a zonal background wind and driven by a local source is transformed into a Sturm-Liouville problem with random potential function. We distinguish between two types of localising mechanisms. The first type is a background effect of localisation symmetrical with respect to the equator which is due to the nodes of the potential function (critical lines). The second is a more subtle effect and forces localisation around the source. It comes from the superposition of the source term with the Green’s kernel expressed in terms of the eigenfunctions of the spectral resolution of the random Sturm-Liouville operators involved. On average this effect is moderate for zero damping and stronger for small non-zero damping.</td>

These ideas are then used to study the propagation of Rossby waves in a basic state with zonally varying middle latitude or low latitude jets. Conditions which allow cross-equatorial wave propagation are presented. For a zonally varying middle latitude jet there is weak wave convergence in regions of decreasing jet speed However this is not sufficient to explain the enhanced wave amplitude found in numerical-model experiments using a zonally varying basic state.</td>

      <td>periodic\ndispersion equation\nphysical explanation\ngrow drawing\nwave</td>
      <td>The effect of weak random currents on time periodic Rossby waves is determined by a perturbation method devised previously. As a result the dispersion equation for the average Rossby wave is obtained and from it the propagation velocity and decay rate are found. These quantities are evaluated explicitly for steady unidirectional random currents. From the results simple forms are obtained when the Rossby wavelength is either large or small in comparison to the correlation length of the current. For some directions of propagation of the wave the velocity is increased by the current whereas for other directions it is decreased and a physical explanation of this is presented. Random currents will scatter the waves and cause them to decay. If the current motion can add to the energy flux of the waves the energy flux may grow drawing energy from the currents. It is found that east-west currents serve mainly to scatter the waves but north-south currents can contribute to the growth of waves. The growth phenomenon is interpreted as an instability of the currents to Rossby waves to which they can give up some of their energy. The maximum growth rate occurs for waves traveling either northwestward or southwestward because the energy flux of these waves is in the same direction as the direction of the random currents.</td>

      <td>The relationship between deep equatorial convection over the western Pacific and atmospheric circulation during November to February 1986–1992 is studied using cross correlations between outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and National Meteorological Center global analyses. We focus on intraseasonal convective events on the 6- to 30-day timescale over two regions: just east of Borneo and over the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) domain to the northeast of New Guinea. Although comparatively little work has been done on this timescale we show that the bulk of the intraseasonal variability in both convection and low-level circulation over the tropical western Pacific occurs in this period range. As a comparison with these higher-frequency events the evolution of COARE convection on the 30- to 70-day timescale is also considered. The results of the historical data analysis are compared to a case study of deep convection associated with strong surface westerly winds during November 1989. This analysis is meant to serve as a benchmark for future case studies from the Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere COARE experiment and other periods. In general 6- to 30-day equatorial convection in the regions studied occurs in conjunction with low-level equatorial westerly wind anomalies paired anomalous cyclonic circulations straddling the equator and a strengthening of the sea level pressure gradient along the equator. The increase in the pressure gradient appears most often tied to the simultaneous equatorward movement of high-pressure systems originating over southeastern Asia and Australia. A surge of trades over the central Pacific also accompanies the development of convection over both study regions. Following the convective peak the low-level westerlies slowly decay as the northern cyclone moves northwestward away from the equator in a track characteristic of a tropical depression. It is also observed that low-level westerly anomalies occur frequently without deep convection. The vertical structure during convective events along the equator on the 30- to 70-day timescale and over Indonesia in the 6- to 30-day band is baroclinic with easterly anomalies at upper levels overlying low-level westerlies. At 200 mbar a strengthened meridional outflow from the OLR signal into a wave train on the equatorward side of the Asian jet is observed to develop following the convective peak suggesting forcing of this circulation by the convection. Over the COARE domain there is evidence that 6- to 30-day convection often occurs in conjunction with deep westerly flow. It is suggested that these types of events are frequently characterized by vertical propagation of westerlies from the surface to the upper troposphere as is shown for a case study from November 1989. This westerly burst episode is shown to have many features in common with the “typical” case as defined from historical data.</td>

Although all OECD countries were invited to participate in the questionnaire survey responses were received from seventeen countries or regions and the paper focuses primarily on this group. The paper presents a short discussion of the importance and relevance of 21st century skills and competencies in the current policy debate and the definitions and conceptual frameworks that have been used in the literature and proposes a new three-dimensional framework consisting of the dimensions of information communication and ethics and social impact. The findings of the questionnaire survey show that most countries or regions cover 21st century skills and competencies in their regulations guidelines or recommendations for compulsory education. However there are few specific definitions of these skills and competencies at national or regional level and virtually no clear formative or summative assessment policies for these skills. The only evaluation regarding their teaching is often left to external inspectors as part of their whole school audits. Similarly there are few teacher training programmes that target the teaching or development of 21st century skills although there exist several teacher training initiatives that focus on developing teachers’ ICT pedagogical skills most of them optional. The paper discusses the implications of these findings especially with regard to the particular role of ICT in the development of these skills and competencies and issues related to assessment practices and teacher training.</td>

This study evaluated one such context the teacher-student relationship specifically the degree of closeness and conflict in the relationship between urban American elementary schoolchildren with significant externalizing or internalizing behavior problems and their teachers. The results suggest that the qualities of the teacher-student relationship predict children's successful school adjustment. Having a relationship with a teacher characterized by warmth trust and low degrees of conflict was associated with positive school outcomes. Some moderation effects were noted including differential effects for warmth on the reading achievement of children with externalizing distress and conflict on the school adaptation of children with internalizing problems.

      <td>Presents an integrative theoretical framework to explain and to predict psychological changes achieved by different modes of treatment. This theory states that psychological procedures whatever their form alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated how much effort will be expended and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces through experiences of mastery further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model expectations of personal efficacy are derived from 4 principal sources of information: performance accomplishments vicarious experience verbal persuasion and physiological states. Factors influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arise from enactive vicarious exhortative and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive vicarious and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes.</td>

The theory distinguishes among three modes of agency: personal agency exercised individually; proxy agency in which people secure desired outcomes by inﬂuencing others to act on their behalf; and collective agency in which people act in concert to shape their future. Contentious dualisms pervade our ﬁeld pitting autonomy against interdependence; individualism against collectivism and communality; and personal agency against social structure. The determinants and agentic blends of individual proxy and collective instrumentality vary cross-culturally. But all agentic modes are needed to make it through the day whatever the cultural context in which one resides. Cultures are diverse and dynamic social systems not static monoliths. Intracultural diversity and intraindividual variation in psychosocial orientations across spheres of functioning underscore the multifaceted dynamic nature of cultures. The growing globalisation and cultural pluralisation of societies and enmeshment in a cyberworld that transcends time distance place and national borders call for broadening the scope of cross-cultural analyses.

      <td>In recent discussions regarding concerns about the academic achievement of US students educational policy makers have suggested the implementation of certain teacher policies. To address the limited empirical research on the putative educational impact of such policies this study used multilevel structural equation models to investigate the longitudinal associations between teacher evaluation and reward policies and student mathematics achievement and dropout with a national sample of students (n = 7779) attending one of 431 public high schools. The student sample included an equal number of boys and girls averaging 16 years of age and included a White (53%) majority. This study examined whether associations between teacher policies and student achievement were mediated by the teacher–student relationship climate. Results of this study were threefold. First teacher evaluation policies that allowed students to evaluate their teachers were associated with more positive student reports of the classroom teaching climate. Second schools with teacher reward policies that included assigning higher performing teachers with higher performing students had a negative association with student perceptions of the teaching climate. Lastly schools with better student perceptions of the teaching climate were associated with lower student dropout rates by students’ senior year. These findings are discussed in light of their educational policy implications.</td>

A drawback of existing indexes is that they estimate no known population parameters. A new coefficient is proposed to summarize the relative reduction in the noncentrality parameters of 2 nested models. Two estimators of the coefficient yield new normed (CFIN) and nonnormed (FIN) fit indexes. CFIN avoids the underestimation of fit often noted in small samples for P. M. Bentler and D. G. Bonett's (see record 1981-06898-001) normed fit index (NFIN). FIN is a linear function of Bentler and Bonett's nonnormed fit index (NNFIN) that avoids the extreme underestimation and overestimation often found in NNFIN. Asymptotically CFIN FIN NFIN and a new index developed by K. A. Bollen (1989) are equivalent measures of comparative fit whereas NNFIN measures relative fit by comparing noncentrality per degree of freedom. All of the indexes are generalized to permit use of Wald and Lagrange multiplier statistics. An example illustrates the behavior of these indexes under conditions of correct specification and misspecification. The new fit indexes perform very well at all sample sizes.</td>

No differences in self-efficacy resulted from the different forms of assessment Students who took the multiple-choice performance test obtained higher scores than did students who took the open-ended test The latter group had poorer calibration that is the degree to which students' judgments of their capability reflect their actual competence. This finding suggests that students' self-perceptions of their mathematics capability may be less accurate than has previously been reported or that students' familiarity with traditional assessment formats creates an expectancy of a performance task that is multiple choice in nature; this expectancy influences self-efficacy judgments regardless of the format used to assess confidence. Differences in the format for assessing self-efficacy and performance altered the predictive utility of self-efficacy judgments. These differences must be accounted for in subsequent studies before researchers can make sound generalizations about the strength of the self-efficacy/performance relationship or the accuracy of students' self-perceptions.</td>

Mortality was associated with resistant bacteria and statistical significance was evident with an odds ratio (OR) 2.828 (95% CI 2.231 -3.584; p = 0.000). ESKAPE pathogens was associated with the highest risk of mortality and with high statistical significance (OR 3.217; 95% CIs; 2.395- 4.321; p = 0.001). Eight studies showed that ABR and especially antibiotic-resistant ESKAPE bacteria significantly increased health care costs.\n\nConclusion\n\nABR is associated with a high mortality risk and increased economic costs with ESKAPE pathogens implicated as the main cause of increased mortality. Patients with non-communicable disease co-morbidities were identified as high-risk populations.</td>

To assess this hypothesis 931 geographically and temporally matched E. coli isolates from human volunteers (hospital inpatients and healthy vegetarians) and commercial poultry products (conventionally raised or raised without antimicrobial drugs) were tested by PCR for phylogenetic group (A B1 B2 D) and 60 virulence genes associated with extraintestinal pathogenic E coli. Isolates resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole quinolones and extended-spectrum cephalosporins (n = 331) were compared with drug-susceptible isolates (n = 600) stratified by source. Phylogenetic and virulence markers of drug-susceptible human isolates differed considerably from those of human and poultry isolates. In contrast drug-resistant human isolates were similar to poultry isolates and drug-susceptible and drug-resistant poultry isolates were largely indistinguishable. Many drug-resistant human fecal E coli isolates may originate from poultry whereas drug-resistant poultry-source E. coli isolates likely originate from susceptible poultry-source precursors.</td>

      <td>How Safe is Chicken Litter for Land Application as an Organic Fertilizer?: A Review</td>
      <td>antibiotic residues chicken litter contaminants growth hormones heavy metals human animal and environmental health pathogenic microorganisms</td>
      <td>Chicken litter application on land as an organic fertilizer is the cheapest and most environmentally safe method of disposing of the volume generated from the rapidly expanding poultry industry worldwide. However little is known about the safety of chicken litter for land application and general release into the environment. Bridging this knowledge gap is crucial for maximizing the benefits of chicken litter as an organic fertilizer and mitigating negative impacts on human and environmental health. The key safety concerns of chicken litter are its contamination with pathogens including bacteria fungi helminthes parasitic protozoa and viruses; antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant genes; growth hormones such as egg and meat boosters; heavy metals; and pesticides. Despite the paucity of literature about chicken litter safety for land application the existing information was scattered and disjointed in various sources thus making them not easily accessible and difficult to interpret. We consolidated scattered pieces of information about known contaminants found in chicken litter that are of potential risk to human animal and environmental health and how they are spread. This review tested the hypothesis that in its current form chicken litter does not meet the minimum standards for application as organic fertilizer. The review entails a meta-analysis of technical reports conference proceedings peer-reviewed journal articles and internet texts. Our findings indicate that direct land application of chicken litter could be harming animal human and environmental health. For example counts of pathogenic strains of Eschericiacoli (10(5)-10(10) CFU g(-1)) and Coliform bacteria (10(6)-10(8) CFU g(-1)) exceeded the maximum permissible limits (MPLs) for land application. In Australia 100% of broiler litter tested was contaminated with Actinobacillus and re-used broiler litter was more contaminated with Salmonella than non-re-used broiler litter. Similarly in the US all (100%) broiler litter was contaminated with Eschericiacoli containing genes resistant to over seven antibiotics particularly amoxicillin ceftiofur tetracycline and sulfonamide. Chicken litter is also contaminated with a vast array of antibiotics and heavy metals. There are no standards set specifically for chicken litter for most of its known contaminants. Even where standards exist for related products such as compost there is wide variation across countries and bodies mandated to set standards for safe disposal of organic wastes. More rigorous studies are needed to ascertain the level of contamination in chicken litter from both broilers and layers especially in developing countries where there is hardly any data; set standards for all the contaminants; and standardize these standards across all agencies for safe disposal of chicken litter on land.</td>

      <td>Although the poultry production sector plays a key role in sustaining the majority of animal protein demand in Egypt the deleterious effects of widespread antibiotic resistance on health and environment are currently not well recognized. Litter and dropping samples from broiler and layer poultry farms as well as tilapia samples from the Nile River and aquaculture farms were collected from Upper Egypt. Samples were extracted and examined for tetracycline residues (tetracycline (TC) chlortetracycline (CTC) oxytetracycline (OTC) and doxycycline (DC)] using HPLC. In addition tetracycline resistance genes [tet (M) tet (W) tet (Q) and tet (G)] were screened from pooled intestinal contents collected from twelve broiler farms in Upper Egypt. The antibiotic resistance genes results revealed that tet (W) was confirmed to be expressed in all intestinal samples. In contrast tet (Q) and tet (M) were detected only in 42% and 17% of the samples respectively. CTC and OTC were the antimicrobial compounds with the highest concentrations in poultry litter and droppings with concentrations of 6.05 and 2.47 mu g g(-1) (CTC) and 5.9 and 1.33 mu g g(-1) (OTC) respectively. However the concentrations of DC were significantly higher than those of the other compounds in both aquaculture and Nile River tilapia. The tetracycline residue levels in aquaculture tilapia were significantly higher than those in Nile River tilapia. The hazard quotients (HQs) exceeded 1 for OTC CTC and DC which highlights the great risk of using broiler litter to fertilize agricultural land. Moreover the presence of DC and CTC indicates that consumption of aquaculture tilapia poses a considerable health risk. Therefore poultry litter or droppings containing tetracycline residues and tet resistance determinants used for aquaculture or as farmland fertilizers could be major sources of antibiotic resistance in fish humans and environment.

      <td>Due to the increased demand of animal protein in developing countries intensive farming is instigated which results in antibiotic residues in animal-derived products and eventually antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance is of great public health concern because the antibiotic-resistant bacteria associated with the animals may be pathogenic to humans easily transmitted to humans via food chains and widely disseminated in the environment via animal wastes. These may cause complicated untreatable and prolonged infections in humans leading to higher healthcare cost and sometimes death. In the said countries antibiotic resistance is so complex and difficult due to irrational use of antibiotics both in the clinical and agriculture settings low socioeconomic status poor sanitation and hygienic status as well as that zoonotic bacterial pathogens are not regularly cultured and their resistance to commonly used antibiotics are scarcely investigated (poor surveillance systems). The challenges that follow are of local national regional and international dimensions as there are no geographic boundaries to impede the spread of antibiotic resistance. In addition the information assembled in this study through a thorough review of published findings emphasized the presence of antibiotics in animal-derived products and the phenomenon of multidrug resistance in environmental samples. This therefore calls for strengthening of regulations that direct antibiotic manufacture distribution dispensing and prescription hence fostering antibiotic stewardship. Joint collaboration across the world with international bodies is needed to assist the developing countries to implement good surveillance of antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance.</td>

Thus this study determined the antibiotic resistance and virulence profiles of Enterococcus spp. along the farm-to-fork production chain of an intensive poultry system in the uMgungundlovu District Kwazulu-Natal South Africa. Overall 162 samples along the continuum (growth phase transport and post-slaughter) were evaluated for the presence of Enterococcus spp. using selective media biochemical tests and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Resistance profiles were assessed by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method following the WHO-AGISAR recommended antibiotics panel for Enterococcus spp. Antibiotic resistance and virulence genes were detected using real-time PCR. Clonal relatedness was evaluated by REP-PCR. Overall 131 isolates were recovered across the continuum (34% E. faecalis 32% E. faecium 2% E. gallinarum and 32% other Enterococcus spp.). Resistance to tetracycline (79%) erythromycin (70%) nitrofurantoin (18%) ampicillin (15%) streptomycin (15%) chloramphenicol (10%) ciprofloxacin (4%) tigecycline (4%) gentamicin (4%) teicoplanin (3%) was observed among all Enterococcus spp.; no vancomycin resistance (0%) was recorded. Also 24% of E. faedum were resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin. Twenty-four multidrug resistance (MDR) antibiograms were observed across all species: E. faecium (43%) showed the highest frequency of MDR. The most frequently observed antibiotic resistomes were tetM (76%) and ermB (66%) while smaller percentages were noted for aph(3')-IIIa (12%) and vanC1 (1%). Virulence genes efaAFs (100%) cpd (96%) and gelE (80%) were more prevalent in E. faecalis. Clonality revealed that isolates along the continuum were highly diverse with major REP-types consisting of isolates from the same sampling point. This study highlights the diversity MDR Enterococcus in the food chain with isolates harbouring resistance and virulence genes. These could be reservoirs for the potential transfer of pathogenic enterococci carrying these genes from poultry to humans through the food chain continuum thus underscoring the need for routine antibiotic resistance surveillance in food animals.

      <td>Livestock farming is common in low-income settings as a source of income and animal-sourced food. However there is growing evidence of the harmful health effects of proximity of animals to infants and young children especially through exposure to zoonotic pathogens. Poultry ownership is almost universal in rural Burkina Faso. Poultry feces are a significant risk factor for enteric diseases that are associated with child undernutrition. To investigate the extent of exposure to livestock feces among young children and caregivers we conducted direct observations of 20 caregiver-child dyads for a total of 80 hours (4 hours per dyad) and recorded water quality sanitation and hygiene (WASH)-related behaviors. We also undertook in-depth interviews with these caregivers and focus group discussions with separate groups of men and women who were poultry farmers. Poultry and other livestock feces were visible in all 20 and 19 households respectively in both kitchen areas and in the household courtyards where children frequently sit or crawl. Direct soil ingestion by young children was observed in almost half of the households (45%). Poor handwashing practices were also common among caregivers and children. Although latrines were available in almost all households child feces disposal practices were inadequate. This body of research suggests an urgent need to adapt conventional WASH and livestock interventions to reduce the exposure of infants and young children to livestock feces.</td>

Government animal healthcare providers were rarely visited (9.7%) and respondents more often sought animal health care from pharmacies and village doctors (70.6% and 11.9% respectively) citing the latter two as less costly and more successful based on past performance. Animal husbandry practices that could promote the transmission of microbes from animals to humans included the following: the proximity of chickens to humans (50.1% of households reported that the chickens slept in the bedroom); the shared use of natural bodies of water for human and animal bathing (78.3%); the use of livestock waste as fertilizer (60.9%); and gender roles that dictate that females are the primary caretakers of poultry and children (62.8%).

We randomized households with at least two children in the Nouna district Burkina Faso to a 5-day course of amoxicillin azithromycin cotrimoxazole or placebo. Within each antibiotic-randomized household one child was randomly assigned to receive the antibiotic and the other to receive the placebo. Weight and height measurements were taken at baseline and 30 days following the last study medication dose. Weight-for-height Z (WHZ) height-for-age Z (HAZ) and weight-for-age Z (WAZ) scores were calculated based on the 2006 World Health Organization standards.

Stunting wasting and underweight were defined as HAZ WHZ and WAZ &lt;-2 SD respectively. Multivariable regression models adjusting for potential confounders including household food insecurity and animal ownership were used to assess the relationship between anthropometric indices and dietary diversity.\n\nResults: Of 251 children enrolled in the study 20.6% were stunted 10.0% wasted and 13.9% underweight. Greater dietary diversity was associated with greater HAZ (SD 0.14 95% CI 0.04 to 0.25) among all children. There was no association between dietary diversity and wasting or mid-upper arm circumference in this study.\n\nConclusions: Increasing dietary diversity may be an approach to reduce the burden of stunting and chronic malnutrition among young children in regions with seasonal food insecurity.</td>

In this study our goal was to develop methods to map the disease and expression data and analyze the disorder-tissue associations.\n\nMethods: In this paper we manually classified the human disease proteins into 22 disorder classes and systematically analyzed the properties of disease proteins in different disorder classes. Then we investigated the similarity of different disorder classes by computing the overlap of different disorder proteins and networks. We proposed two novel measures Enrichment Ratio and P-value for comparative analysis of disease proteins across tissues and revealed the associations between disorder classes and tissues/cells.\n\nResults: Compared with non-disease proteins disease proteins tend to express in more tissues have higher expression levels and interact with more other proteins in the network. The overlap percentages of networks are much higher than those of proteins implying that different disorder classes usually influence each other by means of their interacting neighbors. The metabolic muscular and hematologic proteins are related with most tissues/cells and cancer proteins are closely associated with the disorders in immune cells.\n\nConclusion: This paper provided novel methods to investigate proteome-wide disease proteins and their interacting networks in order to understand different disease's associations.

      <td>An open question in human genetics is what underlies the tissue-specific manifestation of hereditary diseases which are caused by genomic aberrations that are present in cells across the human body. Here we analyzed this phenomenon for over 300 hereditary diseases by using comparative network analysis. We created an extensive resource of protein expression and interactions in 16 main human tissues by integrating recent data of gene and protein expression across tissues with data of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The resulting tissue interaction networks (interactomes) shared a large fraction of their proteins and PPIs and only a small fraction of them were tissue-specific. Applying this resource to hereditary diseases we first show that most of the disease-causing genes are widely expressed across tissues yet enigmatically cause disease phenotypes in few tissues only. Upon testing for factors that could lead to tissue-specific vulnerability we find that disease-causing genes tend to have elevated transcript levels and increased number of tissue-specific PPIs in their disease tissues compared to unaffected tissues. We demonstrate through several examples that these tissue-specific PPIs can highlight disease mechanisms and thus owing to their small number provide a powerful filter for interrogating disease etiologies. As two thirds of the hereditary diseases are associated with these factors comparative tissue analysis offers a meaningful and efficient framework for enhancing the understanding of the molecular basis of hereditary diseases.</td>

However within any particular cell or tissue only a subset of proteins is expressed and so only a subset of interactions can occur. Integrating interaction and expression data we analyze here this interplay between protein expression and physical interactions in humans. Proteins only expressed in restricted cell types like recently evolved proteins make few physical interactions. Most tissue-specific proteins do however bind to universally expressed proteins and so can function by recruiting or modifying core cellular processes. Conversely most 'housekeeping' proteins that are expressed in all cells also make highly tissue-specific protein interactions. These results suggest a model for the evolution of tissue-specific biology and show that most and possibly all 'housekeeping' proteins actually have important tissue-specific molecular interactions.

      <td>A network of disorders and disease genes linked by known disorder-gene associations offers a platform to explore in a single graph-theoretic framework all known phenotype and disease gene associations indicating the common genetic origin of many diseases. Genes associated with similar disorders show both higher likelihood of physical interactions between their products and higher expression profiling similarity for their transcripts supporting the existence of distinct disease-specific functional modules. We find that essential human genes are likely to encode hub proteins and are expressed widely in most tissues. This suggests that disease genes also would play a central role in the human interactome. In contrast we find that the vast majority of disease genes are nonessential and show no tendency to encode hub proteins and their expression pattern indicates that they are localized in the functional periphery of the network. A selection-based model explains the observed difference between essential and disease genes and also suggests that diseases caused by somatic mutations should not be peripheral a prediction we confirm for cancer genes.</td>

In-depth proteomic profiling of 30 histologically normal human samples including 17 adult tissues 7 fetal tissues and 6 purified primary haematopoietic cells resulted in identification of proteins encoded by 17294 genes accounting for approximately 84% of the total annotated protein-coding genes in humans. A unique and comprehensive strategy for proteogenomic analysis enabled us to discover a number of novel protein-coding regions which includes translated pseudogenes non-coding RNAs and upstream open reading frames. This large human proteome catalogue ( available as an interactive web-based resource at http://www.humanproteomemap.org) will complement available human genome and transcriptome data to accelerate biomedical research in health and disease.</td>

      <td>Heritable diseases are caused by germ-line mutations that despite tissuewide presence often lead to tissue-specific pathology. Here we make a systematic analysis of the link between tissue-specific gene expression and pathological manifestations in many human diseases and cancers. Diseases were systematically mapped to tissues they affect from disease-relevant literature in PubMed to create a disease-tissue covariation matrix of high-confidence associations of &gt; 1000 diseases to 73 tissues. By retrieving &gt; 2000 known disease genes and generating 1500 disease-associated protein complexes we analyzed the differential expression of a gene or complex involved in a particular disease in the tissues affected by the disease compared with nonaffected tissues. When this analysis is scaled to all diseases in our dataset there is a significant tendency for disease genes and complexes to be overexpressed in the normal tissues where defects cause pathology. In contrast cancer genes and complexes were not overexpressed in the tissues from which the tumors emanate. We specifically identified a complex involved in XY sex reversal that is testis-specific and down-regulated in ovaries. We also identified complexes in Parkinson disease cardiomyopathies and muscular dystrophy syndromes that are similarly tissue specific. Our method represents a conceptual scaffold for organism-spanning analyses and reveals an extensive list of tissue-specific draft molecular pathways both known and unexpected that might be disrupted in disease.</td>

      <td>Construction and analyses of tissue specific networks is crucial to unveil the function and organizational structure of biological systems. As a direct method to detect protein dynamics human proteome-wide expression data provide an valuable resource to investigate the tissue specificity of proteins and interactions. By integrating protein expression data with large-scale interaction network we constructed 30 tissue/cell specific networks in human and analyzed their properties and functions. Rather than the tissue specificity of proteins we mainly focused on the tissue specificity of interactions to distill tissue specific networks. Through comparing our tissue specific networks with those inferred from gene expression data we found our networks have larger scales and higher reliability. Furthermore we investigated the similar extent of multiple tissue specific networks which proved that tissues with similar functions tend to contain more common interactions. Finally we found that the tissue specific networks differed from the static network in multiple topological properties. The proteins in tissue specific networks are interacting looser and the hubs play more important roles than those in the static network.</td>

      <td>The prioritization of candidate disease-causing genes is a fundamental challenge in the post-genomic era. Current state of the art methods exploit a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for this task. They are based on the observation that genes causing phenotypically-similar diseases tend to lie close to one another in a PPI network. However to date these methods have used a static picture of human PPIs while diseases impact specific tissues in which the PPI networks may be dramatically different. Here for the first time we perform a large-scale assessment of the contribution of tissue-specific information to gene prioritization. By integrating tissue-specific gene expression data with PPI information we construct tissue-specific PPI networks for 60 tissues and investigate their prioritization power. We find that tissue-specific PPI networks considerably improve the prioritization results compared to those obtained using a generic PPI network. Furthermore they allow predicting novel disease-tissue associations pointing to sub-clinical tissue effects that may escape early detection.</td>

These keys may be generated by anyone using only the primary sequence of the proteins their taxonomy identifiers and the Secure Hash Algorithm. Two interaction records will have identical keys if they refer to the same set of identical protein sequences and taxonomy identifiers. We define records with identical keys as a redundant group. Our method required that we map protein database references found in interaction records to current protein sequence records. Operations performed during this mapping are described by a mapping score that may provide valuable feedback to source interaction databases on problematic references that are malformed deprecated ambiguous or unfound. Keys for protein participants allow for retrieval of interaction information independent of the protein references used in the original records.\n\nConclusion: We have applied our method to protein interaction records from BIND BioGrid DIP HPRD IntAct MINT MPact MPPI and OPHID. The resulting interaction reference index is provided in PSI-MITAB 2.5 format at http://irefindex.uio.no.

      <td>Background: The tissue specificity of gene expression has been linked to a number of significant outcomes including level of expression and differential rates of polymorphism evolution and disease association. Recent studies have also shown the importance of exploring differential gene connectivity and sequence conservation in the identification of disease-associated genes. However no study relates gene interactions with tissue specificity and disease association.\n\nMethods: We adopted an a priori approach making as few assumptions as possible to analyse the interplay among gene-gene interactions with tissue specificity and its subsequent likelihood of association with disease. We mined three large datasets comprising expression data drawn from massively parallel signature sequencing across 32 tissues describing a set of 55606 true positive interactions for 7197 genes and microarray expression results generated during the profiling of systemic inflammation from which 126543 interactions among 7090 genes were reported.\n\nResults: Amongst the myriad of complex relationships identified between expression disease connectivity and tissue specificity some interesting patterns emerged. These include elevated rates of expression and network connectivity in housekeeping and disease-associated tissue-specific genes. We found that disease-associated genes are more likely to show tissue specific expression and most frequently interact with other disease genes. Using the thresholds defined in these observations we develop a guilt-by-association algorithm and discover a group of 112 non-disease annotated genes that predominantly interact with disease-associated genes impacting on disease outcomes.\n\nConclusion: We conclude that parameters such as tissue specificity and network connectivity can be used in combination to identify a group of genes not previously confirmed as disease causing that are involved in interactions with disease causing genes. Our guilt-by-association algorithm should be useful for the discovery of additional modifiers of genetic diseases and more generally for the ability to associate genes of unknown function to clusters of genes with defined functions allowing for novel biological inference that can be subsequently validated.</td>

Sixteen male subjects participated in this randomized crossover sham-controlled study. They were assigned to either IPC (3 x 5 minutes at 220 mm Hg in both arms with 5-minute rests) or a sham intervention (SHAM) (occlusion pressure set at 10 mm Hg). Forty minutes later their force capabilities on the bench press exercise were assessed (load-velocity relationship with light moderate and heavy loads [30 50 and 70% body mass respectively]; 1 repetition maximum [1RM]; and number of repetitions to failure in 3 sets with 60% RM). The skin temperature (Tsk) of the pectoral and biceps muscles was analyzed as a secondary endpoint by means of infrared thermography. A significant decrease in the Tsk of the pectoral and biceps muscles was observed after the intervention (p &lt; 0.01) and before the warm-up (p &lt; 0.05) in IPC but not in SHAM. However exercise resulted in a similar Tsk increase in the pectoral muscles in both conditions (p &gt; 0.05). No significant differences (p &gt; 0.05 for all) were observed between conditions in the mean velocity attained with light (1.11 +/- 0.11 and 1.09 +/- 0.14 m center dot s(-1) respectively) moderate (0.83 +/- 0.14 and 0.83 +/- 0.16 m center dot s(-1)) nor heavy loads (0.56 +/- 0.17 and 0.54 +/- 0.16 m center dot s(-1)) in 1RM (75.0 +/- 18.9 and 73.1 +/- 15.0 kg for IPC and SHAM respectively; p = 0.181) nor in the number of repetitions performed (52 +/- 13 and 54 +/- 16 repetitions p = 0.492). In summary IPC decreased Tsk locally (biceps) and remotely (pectoral). However it did not alter muscle force capabilities nor the Tsk response to exercise.</td>

IPC consisted of 4 cycles of 5-min occlusion (220mmHg)/5-min reperfusion in each arm and the SHAM protocol was similar to IPC but with only 20mmHg during the occlusion phase. The subjects were informed that both maneuvers (IPC and SHAM) would improve their performance. After IPC CON or SHAM the volunteers performed a maximal 100-m time trial. IPC improved performance (p=0.036) compared to CON. SHAM performance was only better than CON (p=0.059) as a tendency but did not differ from IPC performance. The individual response of the subjects to the different maneuvers was very heterogeneous.

      <td>Prior peripheral hypoxia induced via remote ischemic preconditioning (IPC) can improve physical performance in male athletes through improved O-2 delivery and utilization. Since females may have an innate protective mechanism against ischemia-reperfusion injury and since muscle metabolism during contraction differs between sexes it is relevant to examine the impact of sex in response to IPC to determine whether it is also ergogenic in females. In a randomized crossover single-blind study we investigated muscle performance hemodynamic and O-2 uptake in strength-trained males (n = 9) and females (n = 8) performing five sets of 5 maximum voluntary knee extensions on an isokinetic dynamometer preceded by either IPC (3 x 5-min ischemia/5-min reperfusion cycles at 200 mmHg) or SHAM (20 mmHg). Changes in deoxy-hemoglobin (Delta[HHb] expressed in percentage of arterial occlusion and considered an index of O-2 extraction) and total hemoglobin (Delta[THb]) concentrations of the vastus lateralis muscle were continuously monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy. The metabolic efficiency of the contractions was calculated as the average force/Delta[HHb](avg) ratio. Cohen's effect sizes (ES) +/- 90% confidence limits were used to estimate IPC-induced changes and sex differences. IPC increased total muscular force in males only (13.0% ES 0.64 0.37;0.90) and this change was greater than in females (10.4% difference ES 0.40 0.10;0.70). Percent force decrement was only attenuated in females (-19.8% ES -0.38 -0.77;0.01) which was clearly different than males (sex difference: ES 0.45 -0.16;1.07). IPC also induced different changes between sexes for average muscle O-2 uptake in set 2 (males: 6.4% vs. females: -16.7% ES 0.21 -0.18;0.60) set 3 (males: 7.0% vs. females: -44.4% ES 0.56 -0.17;1.29) set 4 (males: 9.1% vs. females: -40.2% ES 0.51 -0.10;1.13) and set 5 (males: 10.2% vs. females: -40.4% ES 0.52 -0.04;1.09). However metabolic efficiency was not meaningfully different between conditions and sexes. IPC increased muscle blood volume (up arrow[THb]) at rest and during recovery between sets to the same extent in both sexes. Despite a similar IPC-induced initial increase in O-2 delivery in both sexes males displayed greater peripheral O-2 extraction and greater strength enhancement. This ergogenic effect appears to be mediated in part via an up regulated oxidative function in males. We conclude that strength-trained males might benefit more from IPC than their female counterparts during repeated maximal efforts.</td>

      <td>Background: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging and spectroscopy have been applied to assess skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism. Therefore in-vivo NMR may enable the characterization of ischemia-reperfusion injury. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether NMR could detect the effects of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) in healthy subjects.\n\nMethods: Twenty-three participants were included in two randomized crossover protocols in which the effects of IPC were measured by NMR and muscle force assessments. Leg ischemia was administered for 20 minutes with or without a subsequent impaired reperfusion for 5 minutes (stenosis model). IPC was administered 4 or 48 hours prior to ischemia. Changes in (31)phosphate NMR spectroscopy and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals were recorded. 3-Tesla NMR data were compared to those obtained for isometric muscular strength.\n\nResults: The phosphocreatine (PCr) signal decreased robustly during ischemia and recovered rapidly during reperfusion. In contrast to PCr the recovery of muscular strength was slow. During post-ischemic stenosis PCr increased only slightly. The BOLD signal intensity decreased during ischemia ischemic exercise and post-ischemic stenosis but increased during hyperemic reperfusion. IPC 4 hours prior to ischemia significantly increased the maximal PCr reperfusion signal and mitigated the peak BOLD signal during reperfusion.\n\nConclusions: Ischemic preconditioning positively influenced muscle metabolism during reperfusion; this resulted in an increase in PCr production and higher oxygen consumption thereby mitigating the peak BOLD signal. In addition an impairment of energy replenishment during the low-flow reperfusion was detected in this model. Thus functional NMR is capable of characterizing changes in reperfusion and in therapeutic interventions in vivo.</td>

After determination of peak power output during an incremental test they were randomly subjected on different days to a performance protocol preceded by intermittent bilateral cuff pressure inflation to 220 mmHg (IPC) or 20 mmHg (control). To increase data reliability the performance visits were replicated also in a random manner. There was an 8.0% improvement in performance after IPC (control: 303 s IPC 327 s factor SDs of X/divided by 1.13 P = 0.01). This change was followed by a 2.9% increase in peak (V) over dot(O2) (control: 3.95 l/min IPC: 4.06 l/min factor SDs of X/divided by 1.15 P = 0.04) owing to a higher amplitude of the slow component of the (V) over dot(O2) kinetics (control: 0.45 l/min IPC: 0.63 l/min factor SDs of X/divided by 2.21 P = 0.05). There was also an attenuation in the rate of increase in RPE (P = 0.01) and a progressive increase in the myoelectrical activity of the vastus lateralis muscle (P = 0.04). Furthermore the changes in peak (V) over dot(O2) (r = 0.73 P = 0.007) and the amplitude of the slow component (r = 0.79 P = 0.002) largely correlated with performance improvement. These findings provide a link between improved aerobic metabolism and enhanced severe-intensity cycling performance after IPC. Furthermore the delayed exhaustion after IPC under lower RPE and higher skeletal muscle activation suggest they have a role on the ergogenic effects of IPC on endurance performance.</td>

IPC has also been proposed as a novel intervention to improve exercise performance in healthy and diseased populations.\n\nObjective The purpose of this systematic review is to analyze the evidence for IPC improving exercise performance in healthy humans.\n\nMethods Data were obtained using a systematic computer-assisted search of four electronic databases (MEDLINE PubMed SPORTDiscus CINAHL) from January 1985 to October 2015 and relevant reference lists.\n\nResults Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. The collective data suggest that IPC is a safe intervention that may be capable of improving time-trial performance. Available individual data from included studies demonstrate that IPC improved time-trial performance in 67 % of participants with comparable results in athletes and recreationally active populations. The effects of IPC on power output oxygen consumption rating of perceived exertion blood lactate accumulation and cardiorespiratory measures are unclear. The within-study heterogeneity may suggest the presence of IPC responders and non-responders which in combination with small sample sizes likely confound interpretation of mean group data in the literature.\n\nConclusion The ability of IPC to improve time-trial performance is promising but the potential mechanisms responsible require further investigation. Future work should be directed toward identifying the individual phenotype and protocol that will best exploit IPC-mediated exercise performance improvements facilitating its application in sport settings.</td>

It was hypothesized that IPC could affect mechanisms associated with centrally mediated fatigue after a maximally fatiguing protocol. Eleven resistance-trained men completed three 2min maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) via an isometric leg extension preceded by treatments of IPC (three bouts of 5min bilateral leg occlusions at 220mmHg) SHAM (three bouts of 5min at 20mmHg) or CON (30min passive rest). Femoral nerve stimulation was used to explore central and peripheral fatigue pathways. These pathways were profiled at baseline (BL) before the 2min MVC (Pre) and 10s afterwards (Post). Tissue oxygenation was measured throughout the 2min MVCs via near-infrared spectroscopy. The Pre to Post MVC (-71 +/- 56 Nm; d=1.33 +/- 0.51 P&lt;0.01) and twitch torque (-51 +/- 20Nm; d=3.76 +/- 0.84 P&lt;0.01) levels declined without differences between conditions (MVC P=0.67; twitch torque P=0.39). Voluntary activation was also unaffected by condition (P=0.80). Peak deoxyhaemoglobin concentrations were elevated in the IPC trials relative to CON (3.7 +/- 3.0moll(-1); d=1.02 +/- 0.46 P&lt;0.01) and SHAM (3.0 +/- 3.7moll(-1); d=0.82 +/- 0.57 P&lt;0.05).

The occlusion and reperfusion phases were conducted alternately between the thighs with subjects remaining seated. No ischemic pressure was applied during the control (CON) session and subjects sat passively for 40 minutes. Eight minutes after IPC PLACEBO or CON subjects performed 3 repetition maximum sets of the leg extension (2-minute rest between sets) with the predetermined 12RM load. Four minutes after the third set for each condition blood lactate was assessed. The results showed that for the first set the number of repetitions significantly increased for both the IPC (13.08 +/- 2.11; p = 0.0036) and PLACEBO (13.15 +/- 0.88; p = 0.0016) conditions but not for the CON (11.88 +/- 1.07; p &gt; 0.99) condition. In addition the IPC and PLACEBO conditions resulted insignificantly greater repetitions vs. the CON condition on the first set (p = 0.015; p = 0.007) and second set (p = 0.011; p = 0.019) but not on the third set (p = 0.68; p &gt; 0.99). No difference (p = 0.465) was found in the fatigue index and lactate concentration between conditions. These results indicate that IPC and PLACEBO IPC may have small beneficial effects on repetition performance over a CON condition. Owing to potential for greater discomfort associated with the IPC condition it is suggested that ischemic preconditioning might be practiced gradually to assess tolerance and potential enhancements to exercise performance.</td>

      <td>Background: We aimed to investigate the correlation of infrared thermography (IT) with laser Doppler perfusion imager (LDPI) among patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and healthy controls.\n\nMethods: Forty-seven individuals were included: we examined 25 patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and 22 age and gender matched healthy controls. IT of the volar surface of the subjects' left hands was performed to record skin temperature while skin perfusion of the same area was determined using LDPI. All measurements were obtained at room temperature (baseline measurements) and following standardized cold provocation.\n\nResults: Good correlation of baseline measurements was found between IT and LDPI in primary Raynaud patients and healthy controls (r = 0.868 p &lt; 0.0001 vs. r = 0.790 p &lt; 0.0001). Following cold challenge correlation was weaker in both groups (r = 0.742 vs. r = 0.766 p &lt; 0.0001). Correlation after cold provocation was statistically significant among patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon in contrast to controls (Chi Quadrat p = 0.023 vs. p = 0.306).\n\nConclusion: A significant correlation was found between IT and LDPI in primary Raynaud patients and in healthy controls (r = 0.868 and r = 0.742 both p &lt; 0.0001). Following cold provocation correlation decreases in both groups. Thus at room temperature IT might substitute for skin perfusion measured by LDPI. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</td>

      <td>Background-Several studies have shown that both early and late effects of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) protect against myocardial injury after ischemic reperfusion.\n\nMethods and Results-The purpose of this study was to evaluate the late effects of IPC on endothelial function in humans. Late phase of IPC was induced by upper limb ischemia (cuff inflation of over 200 mm Hg for 5 minutes) 6 times a day for 1 month. We evaluated forearm blood flow (FBF) responses to acetylcholine (ACh) and to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) before and after IPC stimulus in 30 young healthy men. FBF was measured using a strain-gauge plethysmograph. The IPC stimulus significantly increased plasma concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) circulating level of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and FBF responses to ACh but these did not change in the control group. The FBF responses to SNP were similar before and after the IPC stimulus. Infusion of N-G-monomethyl-L-arginine a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor completely eliminated the IPC stimulus-induced augmentation of FBF responses to ACh. In the cotralateral arms of subjects that received the IPC stimulus FBF responses to ACh did not change but levels of VEGF and circulating EPCs increased.\n\nConclusions-These findings suggest that repetition of late IPC stimulus augments endothelium-dependent vasodilation in humans through increases in nitric oxide production and number of EPCs under a local condition. Repetition of IPC stimulus may be a simple safe and feasible therapeutic technique for endothelial protection of peripheral vessels.</td>

However how to ensure the security of data sharing within a group and how to efficiently share the outsourced data in a group manner are formidable challenges. Note that key agreement protocols have played a very important role in secure and efficient group data sharing in cloud computing. In this paper by taking advantage of the symmetric balanced incomplete block design (SBIBD) we present a novel block design-based key agreement protocol that supports multiple participants which can flexibly extend the number of participants in a cloud environment according to the structure of the block design. Based on the proposed group data sharing model we present general formulas for generating the common conference key IC for multiple participants. Note that by benefiting from the (v k + 1 1)-block design the computational complexity of the proposed protocol linearly increases with the number of participants and the communication complexity is greatly reduced. In addition the fault tolerance property of our protocol enables the group data sharing in cloud computing to withstand different key attacks which is similar to Yi's protocol.</td>

      <td>Cloud data storage has provided significant benefits by allowing users to store massive amount of data on demand in a cost-effective manner. To protect the privacy of data stored in the cloud cryptographic role-based access control (RBAC) schemes have been developed to ensure that the data can only be accessed by those who are allowed by access policies. However these cryptographic approaches do not address the issues of trust. In this paper we propose trust models to reason about and to improve the security for stored data in cloud storage systems that use cryptographic RBAC schemes. The trust models provide an approach for the owners and roles to determine the trustworthiness of individual roles and users respectively in the RBAC system. The proposed trust models consider role inheritance and hierarchy in the evaluation of trustworthiness of roles. We present a design of a trust-based cloud storage system which shows how the trust models can be integrated into a system that uses cryptographic RBAC schemes. We have also considered practical application scenarios and illustrated how the trust evaluations can be used to reduce the risks and to enhance the quality of decision making by data owners and roles of cloud storage service.</td>

      <td>Wireless body area networks (WBANs) consist of many small low-power sensors through which users could monitor the real-time parameters of patients' physiology remotely. This capability could improve medical care and the monitoring of patients. WBAN devices typically have limited computing storage power and communication capabilities. These limitations restrict the applications that WBANs can support. To enhance the capabilities of WBANs the concept of cloud-assisted WBANs has been introduced recently. By using cloud computing technologies cloud-assisted WBANs can provide more efficient processing of patients' physiology parameters and support richer services. In cloud-assisted WBANs the data of patients' physiology are stored in the cloud. The integrity of the data is very important because these data will be used to provide a medical diagnosis and other medical treatments. To address the issue of integrity in cloud-assisted WBANs we propose an efficient certificateless public auditing (CLPA) scheme. A security analysis of our proposed CLPA scheme shows that it is provably secure against two types of adversaries (i.e. a type-I adversary can replace users' public keys and a type-II adversary can access the master key) in an environment of certificateless cryptography. A detailed performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed CLPA scheme yields better performance over a previously proposed CLPA scheme.</td>

Due to the shared wireless medium between the RFID reader and the RFID tag adversaries can launch various attacks on the RFID system. To thwart different types of attacks we propose an Efficient RFID Authentication Protocol (ERAP) which can accomplish the authentication without disclosing real IDs of the participating tags and provide strong privacy and security protection of the RFID users. ERAP offers the anonymity of tags in addition to tag untraceability. It also provides forward security (forward privacy) which ensures that data transmitted today will still be secure even if secret tag information is revealed by tampering in the future. In this paper we define a formal security model for authentication and privacy in RFID system. Under this model we describe protocol that provably achieves the properties of authentication and privacy. In addition the proposed ERAP requires only little resources to perform the authentication which satisfies the requirement of highly resource-constrained low-cost RFID tags.</td>

      <td>Key-exposure resistance has always been an important issue for in-depth cyber defence in many security applications. Recently how to deal with the key exposure problem in the settings of cloud storage auditing has been proposed and studied. To address the challenge existing solutions all require the client to update his secret keys in every time period which may inevitably bring in new local burdens to the client especially those with limited computation resources such as mobile phones. In this paper we focus on how to make the key updates as transparent as possible for the client and propose a new paradigm called cloud storage auditing with verifiable outsourcing of key updates. In this paradigm key updates can be safely outsourced to some authorized party and thus the key-update burden on the client will be kept minimal. In particular we leverage the third party auditor (TPA) in many existing public auditing designs let it play the role of authorized party in our case and make it in charge of both the storage auditing and the secure key updates for key-exposure resistance. In our design TPA only needs to hold an encrypted version of the client's secret key while doing all these burdensome tasks on behalf of the client. The client only needs to download the encrypted secret key from the TPA when uploading new files to cloud. Besides our design also equips the client with capability to further verify the validity of the encrypted secret keys provided by the TPA. All these salient features are carefully designed to make the whole auditing procedure with key exposure resistance as transparent as possible for the client. We formalize the definition and the security model of this paradigm. The security proof and the performance simulation show that our detailed design instantiations are secure and efficient.</td>

      <td>Key agreement protocol is a fundamental protocol in cryptography whereby two or more participants can agree on a common conference key in order to communicate securely among themselves. In this situation the participants can securely send and receive messages with each other. An adversary not having access to the conference key will not be able to decrypt the messages. In this paper we propose a novel identity-based authenticated multi user key agreement protocol employing a symmetric balanced incomplete block design. Our protocol is built on elliptic curve cryptography and takes advantage of a kind of bilinear map called Weil pairing. The protocol presented can provide an identification (ID)-based authentication service and resist different key attacks. Furthermore our protocol is efficient and needs only two rounds for generating a common conference key. It is worth noting that the com munication cost for generating a conference key in our protocol is only O(n√n) and the computation cost is only O(nm 2 ) where n implies the number of participants and m denotes the extension degree of the finite field Fp m . In addition in order to resist the different key attack from malicious participants our protocol can be further extended to provide the fault tolerant property.</td>

      <td>With the advent of cloud computing data owners are motivated to outsource their complex data management systems from local sites to the commercial public cloud for great flexibility and economic savings. But for protecting data privacy sensitive data have to be encrypted before outsourcing which obsoletes traditional data utilization based on plaintext keyword search. Thus enabling an encrypted cloud data search service is of paramount importance. Considering the large number of data users and documents in the cloud it is necessary to allow multiple keywords in the search request and return documents in the order of their relevance to these keywords. Related works on searchable encryption focus on single keyword search or Boolean keyword search and rarely sort the search results. In this paper for the first time we define and solve the challenging problem of privacy-preserving multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted data in cloud computing (MRSE). We establish a set of strict privacy requirements for such a secure cloud data utilization system. Among various multi-keyword semantics we choose the efficient similarity measure of "coordinate matching" i.e. as many matches as possible to capture the relevance of data documents to the search query. We further use "inner product similarity" to quantitatively evaluate such similarity measure. We first propose a basic idea for the MRSE based on secure inner product computation and then give two significantly improved MRSE schemes to achieve various stringent privacy requirements in two different threat models. To improve search experience of the data search service we further extend these two schemes to support more search semantics. Thorough analysis investigating privacy and efficiency guarantees of proposed schemes is given. Experiments on the real-world data set further show proposed schemes indeed introduce low overhead on computation and communication.</td>

However such assumption may not always be held due to the possibly weak sense of security and/or low security settings at the client. If such a secret key for auditing is exposed most of the current auditing protocols would inevitably become unable to work. In this paper we focus on this new aspect of cloud storage auditing. We investigate how to reduce the damage of the client's key exposure in cloud storage auditing and give the first practical solution for this new problem setting. We formalize the definition and the security model of auditing protocol with key-exposure resilience and propose such a protocol. In our design we employ the binary tree structure and the preorder traversal technique to update the secret keys for the client.

      <td>High-performance industrial control systems with tens to hundreds of sensors and actuators use wired connections between all of their components because they require low-latency high-reliability links to maintain stability; however the wires cause many mechanical problems that moving to wireless links would solve. No existing or proposed wireless system can achieve the latency and reliability required by the control algorithms because they are designed for either high-throughput or low-power communication between a pair or a small number of terminals. A preliminary wireless system architecture is proposed that focuses on low-latency operation through the use of reliable broadcasting semi-fixed resource allocation and low-rate coding. For an industrial printer application with 30 nodes in the control loop and a moderate information throughput of 4.8Mb/s the system can achieve latencies under 2ms for SNRs above 7dB.</td>

To this end an extensive search was conducted to find articles dealing with (a) telemedicine (b) triage (c) priority and (d) sensor; (e) comprehensively review related applications and establish the coherent taxonomy of these articles. ScienceDirect IEEE Xplore and Web of Science databases were checked for articles on triage and priority-based sensor technology in telemedicine. The retrieved articles were filtered according to the type of telemedicine technology explored. A total of 150 articles were selected and classified into two categories. The first category includes reviews and surveys of triage and priority-based sensor technology in telemedicine. The second category includes articles on the three-tiered architecture of telemedicine. Tier 1 represents the users. Sensors acquire the vital signs of the users and send them to Tier 2 which is the personal gateway that uses local area network protocols or wireless body area network. Medical data are sent from Tier 2 to Tier 3 which is the healthcare provider in medical institutes. Then the motivation for using triage and priority-based sensor technology in telemedicine the issues related to the obstruction of its application and the development and utilisation of telemedicine are examined on the basis of the findings presented in the literature.</td>

Integration of IoTs with cloud computing termed as Cloud of Things (CoT) can help achieve the goals of envisioned IoT and future Internet. This IoT-Cloud computing integration is not straight-forward. It involves many challenges. One of those challenges is data trimming. Because unnecessary communication not only burdens the core network but also the data center in the cloud. For this purpose data can be preprocessed and trimmed before sending to the cloud. This can be done through a Smart Gateway accompanied with a Smart Network or Fog Computing.

      <td>Current developments in ICTs such as in Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS) allow us to develop healthcare solutions with more intelligent and prediction capabilities both for daily life (home/office) and in-hospitals. In most of IoT-based healthcare systems especially at smart homes or hospitals a bridging point (i.e. gateway) is needed between sensor infrastructure network and the Internet. The gateway at the edge of the network often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper we exploit the strategic position of such gateways at the edge of the network to offer several higher-level services such as local storage real-time local data processing embedded data mining etc. presenting thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. We then propose to exploit the concept of Fog Computing in Healthcare IoT systems by forming a Geo-distributed intermediary layer of intelligence between sensor nodes and Cloud. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center our Fog-assisted system architecture can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as mobility energy efficiency scalability and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways can enable massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a prototype of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UT-GATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented. We also implement an IoT-based Early Warning Score (EWS) health monitoring to practically show the efficiency and relevance of our system on addressing a medical case study. Our proof-of-concept design demonstrates an IoT-based health monitoring system with enhanced overall system intelligence energy efficiency mobility performance interoperability security and reliability.</td>

This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables smart home smart mobility and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital patient and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety speed and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health assisted living e-medicine implants early warning systems to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management scalability regulations interoperability device–network–human interfaces security and privacy.</td>

      <td>Lately pervasive and ubiquitous computing services have been under focus of not only the research community but developers as well. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Emergency healthcare and latency sensitive services require real-time response. Also it is necessary to decide what type of data is to be uploaded in the cloud without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose Fog computing plays an important role. Fog resides between underlying IoTs and the cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources perform data filtration preprocessing and security measures. For this purpose Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework which we provide in this paper. Moreover since Fog has to deal with mobile nodes and IoTs which involves objects and devices of different types having a fluctuating connectivity behavior. All such types of service customers have an unpredictable relinquish probability since any object or device can quit resource utilization at any moment. In our proposed methodology for resource estimation and management we have taken into account these factors and formulate resource management on the basis of fluctuating relinquish probability of the customer service type service price and variance of the relinquish probability. Implementation of our system was done using Java while evaluation was done on CloudSim toolkit. The discussion and results show that these factors can help service provider estimate the right amount of resources according to each type of service customers.</td>

Chikungunya virus (CHV) diagnosis solutions are not easily accessible and affordable in developing countries. Also old approaches are very slow in identifying and controlling the spread of CHV outbreak. The sudden development and advancement of wearable internet of things (IoT) sensors fog computing mobile technology cloud computing and better internet coverage have enhanced the quality of remote healthcare services. IoT assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to identify possibly infected users from CHV in an early phase of their illness so that the outbreak of CHV can be controlled. Fog computing provides many benefits such as low latency minimum response time high mobility enhanced service quality location awareness and notification service itself at the edge of the network. In this paper IoT and fog based healthcare system is proposed to identify and control the outbreak of CHV. Fuzzy-C means (FCM) is used to diagnose the possibly infected users and immediately generate diagnostic and emergency alerts to users from fog layer. Furthermore on cloud server social network analysis (SNA) is used to represent the state of CHV outbreak. Outbreak role index is calculated from SNA graph which represents the probability of any user to receive or spread the infection. It also generates warning alerts to government and healthcare agencies to control the outbreak of CHV in risk prone or infected regions. The experimental results highlight the advantages of using both fog computing and cloud computing services together for achieving network bandwidth efficiency high quality of service and minimum response time in generation of real time notification as compared to a cloud only model.</td>

      <td>We examined the status of women in the 50 American states in relation to women's and men's levels of health. The status of women in each state was assessed by four composite indices measuring women's political participation economic autonomy employment and earnings and reproductive rights. The study design was cross-sectional and ecologic. Our main outcome measures were total female and male mortality rates female cause-specific death rates and mean days of activity limitations reported by women during the previous month. Measures of women's status were strikingly correlated with each of these health outcomes at the state level. Higher political participation by women was correlated with lower female mortality rates (r = -0.51) as well as lower activity limitations (-0.47). A smaller wage gap between women and men was associated with lower female mortality rates (-0.30) and lower activity limitations (-0.31) (all correlations P &lt; 0.05). Indices of women's status were also strongly correlated with male mortality rates suggesting that women's status may reflect more general underlying structural processes associated with material deprivation and income inequality. However the indices of women's status persisted in predicting female mortality and morbidity rates after adjusting for income inequality poverty rates and median household income. Associations were observed for specific causes of death including stroke cervical cancer and homicide. We conclude that women experience higher mortality and morbidity in states where they have lower levels of political participation and economic autonomy. Living in such states has detrimental consequences for the health of men as well. Gender inequality and truncated opportunities for women may be one of the pathways by which the maldistribution of income adversely affects the health of women.</td>

Using cross-sectional data from the BRAC-ICDDRB Joint Research Project in Matlab Bangladesh this paper examines the impact of membership in BRAC's integrated Rural Development Programme (RDP) on gender equity and health-seeking behaviour. Differences in health care seeking are explored by comparing a sample of households who are BRAC members with a sample of BRAC-eligible non-members. Individuals from the BRAC member group report significantly less morbidity (15-day recall) than those from the non-member group although no gender differences in the prevalence of self-reported morbidity are apparent in either group. Sick individuals from BRAC member households tend to seek care less frequently than non-members. When treatment is sought BRAC members rely to a greater extent on home remedies traditional care and unqualified allopaths than non-member households. While reported treatment seeking from qualified allopaths is more prevalent in the BRAC group non-members use the para-professional services of community health care workers almost twice as frequently. In both BRAC member and non-member groups women suffering illness report seeking care significantly less often than men. The policy and programmatic implications of between group and gender differences in care seeking are discussed with reference to the literature.</td>

We compared their findings on gender differences to those of 12 female and 4 male bipolar patients and 11 male and 19 female schizophrenic patients all treated in the same ECT setting.\n\nResults: Depressed female patients underwent significantly fewer antidepressant drug trials than males before being referred to ECT (t41=2.09 P&lt;0.05). A similar gender difference was found in the treatment of patients suffering from schizophrenia: female patients underwent fewer pharmacological antipsychotic trials than males before being referred to ECT (t28=3.11 P&lt;0.01).

Typically studies report that women have a prevalence rate for depression up to twice that of men (Bebbington 1996; Nolen-Hoeksema 1987). For example Kessler et al. (1994) reported that women in the United States are about two-thirds more likely than men to be depressed and a national psychiatric morbidity survey in Britain showed a similar greater risk of depression for women (Meltzer et al. 1995). Gender differences in depression appear to be at their greatest during reproductive years (Bebbington 1996). Recently my colleagues and I set out to explore some of the possible explanations for gender differences in depression (Nazroo et al. 1997 1998). A starting point to our research was Brown and Harris (1978) who showed that episodes of depression were almost always preceded by a major life event a finding that has been confirmed in a number of other studies. Our sample consisted of 97 couples recruited from an inner city area in Britain who had experienced a total of 115 shared crises made up of one or more major life events. The members of each couple were interviewed separately by different interviewers. The interviews covered the nature of the crisis responses to the crisis role behaviors responsibilities and role commitment quality of marriage childhood experiences and psychiatric disorders.

Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to examine gender differences on the Big Five personality factors (i.e. agreeableness neuroticism openness to experience extraversion and conscientiousness). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the relation between gender and depression and to test whether this association is moderated by neuroticism. Levels of neuroticism agreeableness extraversion and conscientiousness were significantly higher among females than among males; in contrast level of openness to experience was significantly higher among males. Female gender was associated with increased odds of experiencing depression. Results showed that neuroticism played a significant contributory role in the relationship between being female and major depression though the role of gender remained statistically significant after adjustment. These data suggest that gender differences in personality factors specifically neuroticism may play a key role in the well-documented gender difference in depression. Our findings indicate that neuroticism may moderate the association between female gender and increased risk of depression among adults. These findings require replication using longitudinal data.</td>

      <td>Objective: To review the characteristic clinical illness course and risk factors to adolescent depression. Method: A literature review is provided with interpretive comments. Results: The clinical feature profile is likely to reflect the rarity of melancholic depression while the non-melancholic "irritable hostile" pattern appears distinctly increased. A "reactive depressive disorder" is rare in those who get to psychiatric assessment while comorbidity (e.g. anxiety and personality disorders illicit drug use) is the rule. Aetiological determinants and the prognosis generally more relate to comorbid factors than to depression per se. Predisposing and precipitating psychological and social determinants are considered while the efficacies of varying antidepressant strategies remain unclear apart from those with an "anxious" or "irritable" depression where selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor medication has shown utility and where cognitive-behavioural therapy may be relevant. Conclusions: For the majority who develop adolescent depression its expression and outcome appear more a reflection of the propagating determinants most commonly anxiety and personality style. The clinician should determine a treatment plan that not only addresses the depression but which identifies and addresses the contributing features.</td>

He divided respondents into those who met criteria for major depression and exhibited appetite and sleep disturbances and fatigue (somatic depression) and those who met depression criteria but did not exhibit all of these somatic criteria (pure depression). RESULTS: The reanalysis revealed that the prevalence of somatic depression but not pure depression was much higher among women than men. Somatic depression was associated with high rates of pain; among women it was associated with high rates of anxiety disorders and chronic dysphoria. CONCLUSIONS: The gender difference in depression may result from a difference in a specific type of depression—anxious somatic depression.</td>

The correct necessary and sufficient conditions on the stability matrix that ensure asymptotic stability of the observer are presented. These conditions are then reformulated to obtain a sufficient condition for stability in terms of the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the linear stability matrix. The eigenvalues have to be located sufficiently far out into the left half-plane and the eigenvectors also have to be sufficiently well-conditioned for ensuring asymptotic stability. Based on these results a systematic computational algorithm is then presented for obtaining the observer gain matrix so as to achieve the objective of asymptotic stability.</td>

A distributed interval observer is first constructed for uncertain networked systems in which the control algorithm of each agent involves only the upper bound information and the lower bound information of the interval observer associated with itself and its neighbors respectively. With the help of the cooperativity theory it is proved that the interval observer can estimate the piecewise state for each agent and the interval-observer-based control algorithm can drive the uncertain system to achieve coordination behavior. Then time-varying coordinate transformation is introduced to construct a novel interval observer which can eliminate the cooperativity premise on the system matrices and bound the states of all agents in real time. It is shown that the novel interval-observer-based control algorithm can guide the uncertain system to reach coordinated behavior. Finally the numerical simulations are provided to verify the theoretical results.</td>

      <td>This paper presents a new approach to design preserving order and interval observers for a family of nonlinear systems in absence and in presence of parametric uncertainties and exogenous disturbances. A preserving order observer provides an upper/lower estimation that is always above/below the state trajectory depending on the partial ordering of the initial conditions and asymptotically converges to its true values in the nominal case. An interval observer is then constituted by means of an upper and a lower preserving order observer. In the uncertain/disturbed case the estimations preserve the partial ordering with respect to the state trajectory and practically converge to the true values despite of the uncertainties/perturbations. The design approach relies on the cooperativity property and the stability radii mathematical tools both applied to the estimation error systems. The objective is to exploit the stability radii analysis for the family of linear positive systems under the time-varying nonlinear perturbations in order to guarantee the exponential convergence property of the observers while the cooperativity condition determines the partial ordering between the trajectories of the state and the estimations. The proposed approach defined for Lipschitz nonlinearities depends only on two observer matrix gains. The design is reduced to the solution of linear matrix inequalities which are given by the cooperative condition and convergence constraints. An illustrative example is presented to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</td>

In this paper an augmented observer is proposed for discrete-time Lipschitz nonlinear systems subjected to unknown measurement delays enabling a simultaneous estimation for system states and perturbed terms caused by output delays. On the basis of the estimates a sensor compensation technique is addressed to remove the influence from the measurement delays to the system performance. Furthermore an integrated robust estimation and compensation technique is proposed to decouple constant piecewise disturbances attenuate other disturbances/noise and offset the adverse effect caused by the measurement delays. The proposed methods are applied to a two-stage chemical reactor with delayed recycle and to an electromechanical servosystem which demonstrate the effectiveness of the present techniques.</td>

We argue that research should be augmented with a person-centered approach which examines how psychological measures are integrated into configurations. Integrating role and boundary theories we identify three main characteristics of work-nonwork boundary management: (1) cross-role interruption behaviors (work to nonwork and nonwork to work interruptions); (2) identity centrality of work and family roles and (3) perceived control of boundaries. Using a variable-centered approach we refined and validated these measures to create an assessment (Work–Life Indicator) that captured boundary management profiles. The profiles reflect how interruption behaviors identity centralities and boundary control interrelate to cluster into profiles a set of psychological characteristics organized into a pattern of work–nonwork boundary functioning. We identify boundary management profiles and examine their relationships to key work-family outcomes. Regardless of the level and direction of interruption behaviors and centrality of work–family identities we found that low control boundary management profiles (reactors job warriors) tended to experience more negative work and family outcomes than did high control profiles (fusion lovers dividers family guardians eclectics).</td>

Drawing from identity and sensemaking theories we develop a theory of work-life shock events to explain how dual-earner couples perceive and respond to these events. We theorize that partners initially make sense of the event as individuals and then engage in couple-level sensemaking. We argue that each individual’s shock intensity perceptions are shaped by the shock event’s characteristics and the identity factors of role salience hierarchy and future self. A subsequent couple-level process of sensemaking ensues influenced by the salience of the originating domain and partner role as well as relational identity factors. Couple-level shock intensity perceptions result in the couple’s decision regarding resource investment in the shock event’s originating domain.

However applied psychologists have limited understanding of how employee experiences of work–family conflict and enrichment have been affected by this event and what organizations can do to ensure better employee functioning during such societal crises. Adopting a person-centered approach we examine transitions in employees’ work–family interfaces from before COVID-19 to after its onset. First in Study 1 using latent profile analysis (N = 379; nonpandemic data) we identify profiles of bidirectional conflict and enrichment including beneficial (low conflict and high enrichment) active (medium conflict and enrichment) and passive (low conflict and enrichment). In Study 2 with data collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic we replicate Study 1 profiles and explore whether employees transition between work–family profiles during the pandemic. Results suggest that although many remain in prepandemic profiles positive (from active/passive to beneficial) and negative (from beneficial to active/passive) transitions occurred for a meaningful proportion of respondents. People were more likely to go through negative transitions if they had high segmentation preferences engaged in emotion-focused coping experienced higher technostress and had less compassionate supervisors. In turn negative transitions were associated with negative employee consequences during the pandemic (e.g. lower job satisfaction and job performance and higher turnover intent). We discuss implications for future research and for managing during societal crises both present and future.</td>

      <td>Sensemaking identity studies sensenaking perspective</td>
      <td>Sensemaking involves turning circumstances into a situation that is comprehended explicitly in words and that serves as a springboard into action. In this paper we take the position that the concept of sensemaking fills important gaps in organizational theory. The seemingly transient nature of sensemaking belies its central role in the determination of human behavior whether people are acting in formal organizations or elsewhere. Sensemaking is central because it is the primary site where meanings materialize that inform and constrain identity and action. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the concept of sensemaking. We do so by pinpointing central features of sensemaking some of which have been explicated but neglected some of which have been assumed but not made explicit some of which have changed in significance over time and some of which have been missing all along or have gone awry. We sense joint enthusiasm to restate sensemaking in ways that make it more future oriented more action oriented more macro more closely tied to organizing meshed more boldly with identity more visible more behaviorally defined less sedentary and backward looking more infused with emotion and with issues of sensegiving and persuasion. These key enhancements provide a foundation upon which to build future studies that can strengthen the sensemaking perspective.</td>

      <td>Where Do I Go from Here? Sensemaking and the Construction of Growth-Based Stories in the Wake of Denied Promotions</td>
      <td>Sensemaking Growth-Based career proactivity theorical contributions</td>
      <td>Denied promotions occur when individuals go up for but do not receive promotions at work. The extant literature focuses on the negative implications of denied promotions. We argue in contrast that individuals can ultimately benefit from denied promotions and experience positive outcomes when they construct growth-based stories about the event. Drawing on a sensemaking perspective we articulate when individuals are likely to construct growth-based denied promotion stories highlighting the identity and social conditions that support such stories. We then link growth-based denied promotion stories to the positive behavioral outcomes of work engagement and career proactivity via increases in resilience in their career identities. Finally we situate denied promotions in the broader context of the career and address how responses to denied promotions are influenced by past responses to career setbacks and may shape future responses to career setbacks. Our model provides theoretical contributions to the literature on denied promotions careers positive organizational scholarship and sensemaking.</td>

      <td>Identity Liminality Career Identity growth</td>
      <td>Liminality defined as a state of being betwixt and between social roles and/or identities is the hallmark of an increasingly precarious and fluctuating career landscape. The generative potential of the liminality construct however has been restricted by six key assumptions stemming from the highly institutionalized nature of the rites of passage originally studied. As originally construed liminality (1) implied both an objective state and the subjective experience of feeling betwixt and between and was (2) temporary (3) obligatory (4) guided by elders and/or supported by a community of fellow liminars (5) rooted in culturally legitimate narratives (6) and led to a progressive outcome i.e. the next logical step in a role hierarchy. By recasting these assumptions as variables we improve the construct’s clarity precision and applicability to contemporary liminal experiences that are increasingly under-institutionalized. We illustrate the utility of our updated conceptualization by arguing that under-institutionalized liminality is both more difficult to endure and more fertile for identity growth than the highly institutionalized experiences that gave rise to the original notion. Drawing from adult development theory we further propose that for under-institutionalized experiences to foster identity growth the identity processes involved need to be more akin to identity play than identity work. We discuss the theoretical implications of our ideas for research on liminality identity and careers.</td>
